LICENSE TO USE

ActiveTree grants you the license to use the software with a license file automatically
attached with the downloaded archive. The binary, the demo examples, and others
accompanying with the media or electronically downloaded archives are collectively known
as "Software". Each of such software product when delivered with media or electronically
received from ActiveTree needs a separate product license which is usually included into
the delivered archive or emailed to you seperately. If this is a trial version, the license
attached to the product might expire after the designated period and you will not be able
to run the product. You might consider buying a permanently licensed product to avoid such
expiry. If you think the software is not licensed by you or your organization you should
discontinue using it.

LICENSE TO DISTRIBUTE

You can distribute the component with your product as long as the license you bought entitled
you to do so. If the license you bought is not eligible for redistribution make sure you
buy or upgrade the license in order to be eligible for distribution.

Install the activetree software along with your application/IDE in order to support the
functioning of your application. The end user (potentially your customers) can not further
develop, deploy and distribute it from your product installation. Your tool/application can
not attach activetree component to the software developed by your customers while using your
tool (e.g. an IDE)/application.

In no case, you should share the library and the license key to other business entity (another
company or organization).

Note: You are not allowed to wrap the functionality of the product into your product and resale
your product for the same purpose as we do.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

In NO EVENT will activetree be liable for any kind of loss of revenue, data, profit, or potential
loss or damage that might have happened directly, indirectly, incidentally, intentionally, and
other kinds of loss or damage. ActiveTree is not going to compensate or refund any loss or damage
because of installing and using our software in any system either yourself or by some one else.
