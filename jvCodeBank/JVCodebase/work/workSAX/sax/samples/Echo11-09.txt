COMMENT:   A SAMPLE set of slides  
COMMENT:  FOR WALLY / WALLIES 
COMMENT: 
    DTD for a simple "slide show".

COMMENT:  Defines the %inline; declaration 
COMMENT: 
    This DTD does some of what the W3C is getting ready to do with its
    "XHTML" work (nee "Voyager").  It differs from the current WG draft
    because it uses namespaces correctly (!), and it isn't as complete
    even for HTML 3.2 support (much less 4.0) or, probably, correct.

    Note that what XHTML needs to do is become modular enough that XHTML
    can be used as a mixin with other document types, including either
    "the whole megillah" or just selected modules (e.g. omitting tables).
    That must work both ways ... other things as mixins to XHTML, and
    XHTML as a mixin to other things.

    THIS WILL BE REPLACED WITH A BETTER DTD AT SOME POINT.
