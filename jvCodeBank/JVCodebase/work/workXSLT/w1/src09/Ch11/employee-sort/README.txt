	XSLT Sorting and Filtering

Input: employee-directory.xml.
Output: [given] emp{1-5}*.html

Task:
Study the HTML in emp*.html.
Produce 5 stylesheets, one each that produces the corresponding HTML.
1. sorts by last name: Last, First, Email, Cell Phone
2. reverse sort by 1st project (displays only 1st project):
   1st project, Last, First, Home, Cell
3. same as 2, but displays all projects
4. sort by female/male (display sex), show all projects (same as 2)
5. sort by Last; Last, First, Title, all Projects

Hint: The 5 stylesheets are very similar. Do them in the order above 
and the changes between one and the next will be only a few lines.
