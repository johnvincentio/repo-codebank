
Pretty XML Tree Viewer 1.0 (15 Oct 2001):
An XPath/XSLT visualisation tool for XML documents

Written by Mike J. Brown and Jeni Tennison.
No license; use freely, but please credit the authors if republishing elsewhere.

Use this stylesheet to produce an HTML document containing an ASCII art
representation of an XML document's node tree, as exposed by the XML parser
and interpreted by the XSLT processor. Note that the parser may not expose
comments to the XSLT processor.

See tree-view.xsl for Usage Notes.

Stylesheets from

Results are not pleasing in Netscape 4.7x, so I recommend
either Netscape 6.x, IE 5.5 or higher, or Opera 5.2 or higher.
