-- Inventory consists of barcodes. There may be many physical locations.-- A barcode may physically be in storage (available) or not.-- If unavailable, a barcode may be in manufacturing, or maybe at a client site,-- subject to buyer approval. Such a barcode is not technically in the inventory,-- but it needs to stay in the inventory until someone actually pays for it AND-- it is shipped.---- Each inventory has a target quantity for each barcode--
