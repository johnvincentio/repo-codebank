          <h3>Treasure!</h3>
          <p>This page is about saving those little treasures of life, the lessons I have learnt, almost always the hard way. Although many of these lessons I will <strong>never forget</strong>, it is helpful to brain dump, not just as storage, but also because it strangely makes me feel better! </p>

        <h2><a name="TOP" id="TOP"></a>Lessons Learned:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> I have been yanked from my complacency and challenged to think. The bad news is that that is stressful; the good news is that now maybe I can learn. </li>
          <li>This course is very tough, not because of the technology, but because it challenges, and <strong>does damage to the way I think</strong>.</li>
          <li>I am being asked to define an accepted word, for example technology, to challenge me to think beyond what is normal and acceptable.</li>
          <li>Such definitions require an unusual precision. Half baked thinking is not good enough.</li>
          <li>The projects having a generalized description are a challenge for me to think.</li>
          <li>The generalized project descriptions provide for so many solutions.</li>
          <li>If there are so many solutions, it is not so much about doing it right. Doing the work my way surely becomes the key.</li>
          <li>If I can do the work my way, then I can just <strong>relax and have fun with it</strong>.</li>
          <li>I can always resubmit my work, so <strong>chill out</strong>!!!!</li>
          <li>If I can resubmit, the key <strong>must be to get it, at some point</strong>.</li>
          <li>Each class brings new lessons (as each day brings new lessons in life).</li>
          <li>As I learn more I can go back and redo my work - relax, do my best, do better later if I wish. </li>
          <li>The hardest part of the homework is thinking through the issues and structuring the question so that the solution will be useful, meaningful and doable within a sensible time frame, and at an acceptable cost.</li>
          <li>I made my life a lot harder by taking it upon myself to define the words of another. I had forgotten a golden corporate rule: Demand a precise definition of a project; hand it back until I get a clear project definition that I find acceptable. </li>
          <li>I had forgotten how to think.</li>
          <li>I had forgotten how to solve problems.</li>
          <li>I have had to remember how to take apart a big, hard to define project, into smaller and even smaller components, until each component becomes easy to define. </li>
          <li>Define the project so that I can be motivated by the project.</li>
          <li>Ask questions until absolutely clear.</li>
          <li>Do not try to glean meanings from the words of another. <strong>ASK</strong>.....</li>
          <li>The questions to ask a client will vary by client.</li>
          <li>If I conducted a lot of interviews, I would probably end up with a huge array of questions, broken down by user type.</li>
          <li>There is so much more to conducting interviews than meets the eye. </li>
          <li>Too many words, noone will read the page. Keep it brief, consider using a picture.</li>
          <li>The 20 questions is a starting point. This list will evolve.</li>
          <li>I found that the interview moves through the following categories:
              <ul>
                <li>Corporate</li>
                <li>Products</li>
                <li>Customers</li>
                <li>Competitors</li>
                <li>Design</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>By the time I got to asking questions about the design, the questions had already been answered.</li>
          <li>Know who and what the business is and the design sorts itself out. </li>
          <li>Design questions are answered by the other issues.</li>
          <li>Really do not need 20 questions to reach the goal.</li>
          <li>The goal is to understand the basics of the requirements of the user. </li>
          <li>It has been 23 years since I was last in education. I have come to realize that education provides an environment in which the student has the time and the space to think and to learn.</li>
          <li>I have been learning for the last 23 years pretty much non stop. However, within a corporate environment, the learning is for a purpose, to solve a current problem, quickly. There is no time to think through a problem and so big holes appeared in my knowledge and experience.</li>
          <li>Education is putting me into positions I have made a point of avoiding. I avoided these things because I am poor at these things, and I have always been fortunate enough to have others in the team to take care of the issues I would duck.</li>
          <li>Now I have the time and the space to fill the holes. <strong>Education..... </strong></li>
          <li>Personas allow me to design software that is not only aimed at people like myself. Designs can be crafted for the people who will be using the software.</li>
          <li>The personas tend to have a lot in common. To some extent, this should be expected as Universities offer services to a limited audience.</li>
          <li>Choose personas that will make or break the site. Doubtless there are others, but for a first hack, I would think this limitation is sensible.</li>
          <li>Be careful what I think; if I think something is hard, it will become so, and I will experience all of the emotions and difficulties associated with doing something that is hard. </li>
          <li>If something is hard for me to do, think about ways of making it easier.</li>
          <li>Be the person who can do.</li>
          <li>Start with a rough sketch, keep it simple, yet encompassing the required items.</li>
          <li>Personas are very hard to create. I only have my experiences and my imagination.</li>
          <li>If you want to know how an 18 year old girl,  prospective undergraduate English literature student would think, feel and react, just go ask one! Sure beats me guessing, and must be a lot easier!</li>
          <li>I either turn this personas stuff into fun or I simply can't do it.</li>
          <li>I have made a career of putting together nuts and bolts, as it were. Now I have to talk about what other people are thinking, what could be their goals, how they do things and how they feel about it! No wonder this hurts!</li>
          <li>With the user scenarios in mind, I re-examined the 10 web sites from my competitive review. Most of them yielded little of value, while the better sites provided most of the more usable information. </li>
          <li>Aberdeen University was an exception. The Prospective Students page has been divided into user type. This is unique. This could be very useful.</li>
          <li>In my competitive review, I disliked the Aberdeen University web site, largely because it lacked so much key information. I now note the site is a joy to navigate by user type. For my competitive review, it should be noted, it scored high marks except for quality, the result of the missing information.</li>
          <li>I think that a web site that is designed by user type is a joy to navigate if you happen to be one of the user types. Otherwise, it is just plain unpleasant looking for things that just don't seem to be in the right place. </li>
          <li>so OK,<strong> presentation is important. </strong></li>
          <li>It is amazing to me just how well oriented, thoroughly positioned, most sites are to their business. ex, a bank feels like a bank.</li>
          <li>low cost feel tends to feel like cheap, poorly made.</li>
          <li>friendly tends to not look like high tech.</li>
          <li>
            <h4>high tech is hard to make feel like low cost and friendly.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>maybe just a compromise.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>when I find a possible site match, check their partners - they are probably somewhat similar in feel. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>create distinctions where previously there were none.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>what is my brand?</h4>

        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>I have forgotten how to solve complicated situations. Not knowing the answer or how to go about solving it, is the point of the exercise. Think about the options, list them, along with the pros and the cons. Choose one, and run with it. Learn from it. If not done, or just want to have some fun, choose another option etc.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Do not spin wheels or chase tail. Choose an option and run with it. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Know when to say when. If not working, stop, think, ask.....shake it up, and choose again. </h4>
          </li>

          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Do not turn an assignment into a huge mental puzzle. Make a choice and/or get help.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Thinking it through is just fine, but remember that working with the problem will reveal much about the problem, allowing better choices to be made. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>I keep being confronted with what I don't know I don't know. </h4>

            <h4>It doesn't matter what I do today because in a few months time it will look pretty inadequate anyway!</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Running down the option is often faster than sitting around thinking about it. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Do not use brute force. Think about it, choose an option, run with it. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>There is doing it and doing it better, and they are not the same. </li>
          <li>What I liked about the Essex University web site home page is that it is incredibly practical. The navigation is simply outstanding, it is clear and obvious what to do next, on all pages. It has been designed very skillfully to provide a practical user experience. It gets it done.</li>
          <li>What I don't like, now that I can see it, is the lack of graphical imagery. Sure it has some, but it is very basic, not really invocative, the inner pages could use some imagery.</li>
          <li>The University web sites look so alike. That's the trouble with conventions. Everybody thinks it is essential to follow the conventions, and so they do, but then everything looks the same, ordinary. It is very tough to get in the top 20% of anything looking ordinary. </li>
          <li>Life is to be sampled, not consumed.</li>
          <li>The abstract I have to first turn into the logical.</li>
          <li>I think in the literal world.</li>
          <li>I think in the abstract world when it suits me, in particular when I am trying to be understood and/or convincing. </li>
        </ul>
