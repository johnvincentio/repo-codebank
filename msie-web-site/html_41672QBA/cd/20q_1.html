        <h1><a name="TOP" id="TOP"></a>20 Questions to Ask a Client:</h1>
        <p>These questions are hard to construct because each client will be different. I have constructed a large list, which I propose to use as a base for the next part of the homework. </p>
        <p>I have limited experience of this and so I propose to make this up as I go. Hopefully, this list will help me to learn some lessons. </p>
        <p>I would think that for each interview:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I would start off with a few top-level questions about the company and go from there. </li>
          <li>I would have to chop and change my questions to get useful responses. </li>
          <li> I would have to listen carefully. </li>
          <li> My primary task would be to listen. </li>
          <li> Many of the questions would not apply to specific cases. </li>
          <li> Some questions would not be answered.</li>
          <li>I will learn better questions, I will revise my lists.</li>
          <li>I will improve my interview technique.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I would imagine that no two interviews would be the same. </p>
        <p>The following is a lengthy list of possible questions. If you wish, <a href="#M1">click here t</a>o see a summary list of questions that I propose to use for a medium sized company. </p>
