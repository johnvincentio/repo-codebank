          <p>I propose to make my basic notes from the course right here! By the way, the interesting item is Mount Olympic.</p>

        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>Favorite Web Sites </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Favorite: eBay</li>
          <li>Visit most: google excluding search engines: NY Times/Guardian</li>
          <li>Money: eBay, for computers/hobbies.</li>
          <li>useful: google/jeeves</li>
          <li>most pleasing: not sure, I'm practical. I am at the site for a reason, I want something. I want to get it as fast as I can, with the least expenditure of effort. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Well Designed Web Site </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>no bad links</li>
          <li>find/search/navigate</li>
          <li>no flash intro</li>
          <li>up to date, complete, all together in one place information</li>
          <li>user specfic</li>
          <li>load fast</li>
          <li>no ads</li>
          <li>no popups</li>
          <li>no nuisances</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Successful Web Site </h3>
        <ul>
          <li> Site owner's goals must be being met.</li>
          <li>Site user's goals must be being met.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How does the site make money? This issue must be addressed.</p>
        <h3>Expert Review</h3>
        <p>An expert is someone who is not involved. An outside perspective. Everyone will find out whether he is an expert the moment he opens his mouth. Often used to examine a product etc. </p>
        <p>A review is often used as justification, to show that something needs to be done. It reveals best practices, and shows how the current practices compare. If you are already in the top 50%, then probably nothing needs to be done. If you are in the bottom 20% a site redesign could have a significant impact on the business. </p>
        <p>The 3 clicks rule is a myth. 5 Clicks are better if the user instinctively knows what to click. The user will find his quarry much faster and be happier.</p>
        <p>There are <strong>different types of manager</strong>; tactical, strategic. Power is a key part of management.</p>
        <h3>Brand </h3>
        <p>A familiar identification, generally known, instantly recognizable. A brand is the subtotal of all of your interactions with an organization.</p>
        <p>Then, do we all have a brand image (of ourselves, and others of us)?</p>
        <p>And, of course, perception is reality.</p>
        <p><strong>Barnacle Growth</strong> - growth by sticking things onto other things.</p>
        <h3>Card Layout Exercise</h3>
        <p>The 5 colleges, as an example. Note the missions statement, a strategy declaration. On a board, setup the following sections:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users</li>
          <li>Goals</li>
          <li>Problems</li>
          <li>Solutions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Allow everyone to write down what they want. This way everyone gets heard. Don't have to deal with difficult people. Don't need to consider everything, thus can avoid unreasonable people. </p>
        <p>Users have diferent needs. Break them down into groups (granularity).</p>
        <h3><strong>Card Sort</strong></h3>
        <p>We all took ten cards and wrote on them different pages for the web site. For example, faculty, course info, etc. We gathered the cards and placed duplicates together. Thus, we were left with page names for our site. Then we place the cards in a heirachy. Where a link needs to reference another card, a link mark is made on the card. <strong>The end result is a site map.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Homework Comments: </strong> </p>
        <p>The mission statement frames the rest. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create real people, tell the story. User scenario. The story talks about what they do and how they go about it, an ideal site. </li>
          <li>User types; scenarios within each type.</li>
          <li>Use a picture, use google image search.</li>
          <li>Check a web site; compare with reality. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Courtney just pointed out that by using Prt Sc and MS Paint you can <br />
  accomplish the same thing.&nbsp; He's right.&nbsp; And that would certainly be <br />
  cheaper! <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Client Interview </h3>
        <p>Some comments:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fortune 500 companies usually do it well.</li>
          <li>Find who does it well.</li>
          <li>Similar level. </li>
          <li>Saab analogy - impressions, feelings.</li>
          <li>visually convey, leverage the brand, emotions/feelings. </li>
          <li>separate their wish list from their brand.</li>
          <li>people make instant judgements.</li>
          <li>We are trying to convey these feelings. Which site do you feel works the best?</li>
          <li>Which one meets the goals?</li>
          <li>Designer must be able to ask the right questions. </li>
          <li>make active the window to be copied. </li>
          <li>ALT + PRNTSCRN</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><li>MS Paint, new window</li>
          <li>Edit, Paste </li>
          <li>Choose the select icon (top left, 2nd column, 1st row).</li>
          <li>Outline the area to be selected.</li>
          <li>  Edit, Copy </li>
          <li>Open another session of MS Paint.</li>
          <li>Edit, Paste</li>
          <li>File, Save As, file.jpg in docroot/images. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There is nothing without contrast. It is contrast that draws the eye to something. Eye is drawn to what is different - make the rest the same.</p>
        <p>Abstract -&gt; literal. Abstract of beauty - lesson is that beautiful experience is not beautiful.</p>
        <p>What is the foreground? Many opinions, I think it is whatever I am looking at at the time.</p>
        <p>Look for Key words </p>
        <h2>Usability studies;</h2>
        <p> looking for images that align with the key words.</p>
        <p>Looking for what is missing.</p>
        <p>Who does it serve?</p>
        <p>What is the info? (is it too much or too little?). </p>
        <p>Start with clear goals.</p>
        <p>Questions formed around the goals.</p>
        <p>What, why, what else?</p>
        <p>Know the user + my own goals ; then build a scenario; then build the questions.</p>
        <h2>WireFrame</h2>
        <p>Where should things go? This is the goal .</p>
        <p>Search engines discussion may be later. How to optimize search engine hits.</p>
        <p>Test site map.</p>
        <p>Not which is the best? Test feelings, emotions.</p>
        <p>What works for the users?</p>
        <p>Ask Them</p>
        <p>Choose users: normally want a wide base, not too skilled with the technology, nor too knowledgable about the content.. For a highly specialized site, for example medicine, could still choose a nurse. </p>
        <h2>Final Project</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Careful with busy work. Craft the project to maximize the lessons learned. </li>
          <li>Stretch in new directions.</li>
          <li>Have fun.</li>
          <li>Do stuff that I could use again.</li>
          <li>Definbe the goals of the project.</li>
          <li>Flow charts.</li>
          <li>Tech doc.</li>
          <li>Strategy</li>
          <li>Competitve study</li>
          <li>Review</li>
          <li>UML?</li>
          <li>Wirefeames/Usability.</li>
          <li>Who are the users?</li>
          <li>Write up lessons learned.</li>
        </ul>
