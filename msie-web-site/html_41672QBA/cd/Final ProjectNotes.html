        <p>Here are some thoughts when working on the project. If you find yourself stuck, or not sure where to start, just pick one of the things off this list: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make a list of 20 things that you could do to improve the site. Next week add 10 more, then 10 more. The first 15 are usually easy. The next 15 are harder. The next 10 are the real gems. Ask your peer partner to help when you're stuck. </li>
          <li>Go into detail with at least one of these ideas. You should have a description of how it works, wireframes, and possibly a simple flow chart. </li>
          <li>Look at what databases will be used on this website. Also think a little bit about how these databases tie in with existing company databases. </li>
          <li>Review competitor sites and see what best practices you should adopt </li>
          <li>Outline who the users of this website are, and what the goals of the website are. </li>
          <li>Pick a cool tool or technology that's on a website which is VERY different than yours. Change that tool or technology or implementation to fit within your website. For instance what if you had a "campus wide" Mapquest to find your way around the campus? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>use templates - whole site working now, all pages intact.</p>
        <p>Use bogus data.</p>
        <p>One meeting with the client, build a working prototype.</p>
        <p>Use a placeholder and keep programming.</p>
        <p>Choose, but choose wisely.</p>
        <p>Pick on whatever you could start on easiest - most access to information.</p>
        <p>System, application or presentation - Any.</p>
        <p>Trick is to pick one and dig as deep as you can - pick one and focus on it.</p>

      gswitch jason: John you had asked something about pictures for your final project and I wasn't quite sure where you were going with it.<br />
      gswitch jason: What were you thinking the images would be of?<br />
      jv2351: I plan to produce a page showing some inventory products.....either a manu. inventory or a retailers inv.....wanted to play with the code to pull the info from a DB and display it.... etc allow the users to do the usual.....<br />
      jv2351: DB item would be a number, a URL and some blurb....<br />
      gswitch jason: John sounds like a great use of wireframes. :-)<br />
      jv2351: another page to manage the page...<br />
      jv2351: OK...I can do that....<br />
      jv2351: Is the intention of the exercise to produce wireframes?<br />
      gswitch jason: I imagine that your final deliverable might be:<br />
      gswitch jason: an executive summary of what you're desiging<br />
      gswitch jason: clearly outlined goals<br />
      gswitch jason: feature list<br />
      gswitch jason: user profile (just for perspective... this could be a sentence)<br />
      gswitch jason: a series of wireframes<br />
      gswitch jason: maybe a flowchart to tie the interactions together (if appropriate)<br />
      gswitch jason: maybe an database specification<br />
      gswitch jason: Maybe some notes on similar commercial software that you've researched<br />
      gswitch jason: I don't think pretty pictures would add all that much to this... :-)<br />
      jv2351: OK....no coding either...<br />
      gswitch jason: If you have some code great... but not necessary<br />
      jv2351: OK.....<br />
      gswitch jason: A permissions checklist is another good thing that might apply<br />
      gswitch jason: For instance if there are 4 or 5 major user types, that can access different functions... that might be useful to plot out.<br />
      gswitch jason: You'll probably find that some areas are Fuzzier than others, just because you don't have an unlimited ammount of time.<br />
      jv2351: OK<br />
      gswitch jason: Cool!<br />
      birkinMSIE: permissions checklist -- cool idea<br />
    Laura MSIE: it's about time Bill</p>
        <p>gswitch jason: Birkin, yeah those can get pretty complex pretty quickly too.<br />
          birkinMSIE: but such an essential part of the design process... good to be able to show info up front<br />
          birkinMSIE: hadn't thought of that<br />
          gswitch jason: it's also very accessable to non-technical people.<br />
          gswitch jason: in John's case he has sales people getting into the system, and marketing putting in promotions for sales people, and people on the floor putting stuff in, and managers running reports. Some key customers might be able to log in<br />
        gswitch jason: for specific information.</p>
        <p>gswitch jason: so some people can view inventory, and other people can't. Some people can only view certain product lines, while other people can view all product lines. The people on the floor probably aren't super computer savy, so they<br />
          gswitch jason: have to be locked out of places they might accidently mess something up.<br />
