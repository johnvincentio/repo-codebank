          <h3>Creative Lead Assignment </h3>
      <p>I have just been hired as a creative lead to redesign my new client's web site. </p>
          <p>This assignment has many parts;<a href="#TOP"> Interview the client </a>and review the client's requirements. <a href="Interview2.html">Then I will need to spend some time looking for 6 URLs</a>, 3 home pages and 3 content pages, that will work for his requirements. It would be better if I could provide actual screen shots. Finally, I will present my findings and make notes of my client's feedback. </p>

        <h2><a name="TOP" id="TOP"></a>Client Interview </h2>
        <p>My new client is 360Networks.com. It has taken many months to get this far, the project being subject to a number of problems to date. However, the meeting with Steve Porter on 10/1/2003 went very well. He was well presented, spoke eloquently and with much enthusiasm. They are a high technology telecoms company, smaller than the big boys like Sprint and Bell Canada, although they offer similar services.</p>
        <p>The mission is to provide high speed transmission networks and to be an all service provider for small to large businesses. They offer high quality products and services, delivered in a timely manner, backed up with excellent support services. Their main competitive advantage is that, due to their smaller size, they are able to do so at considerably less cost than their competitors. </p>
        <p>They are largely based in Canada but plan to expand to the whole of North America. They currently have a web site at <a href="http://www.360networks.com">www.360networks.com</a>. The colors and brand image currently in use on the home page are to be used for the project. Due to acquisitions and mergers, the web site is a collection of pages, featuring various products and services from the various companies. This project must provide a one company look and feel. </p>
        <p>Their customers are companies that need lots of bandwidth, usually businesses that do a lot of computing over the internet. The businesses include banking, investments, medical imaging, graphical imaging and entertainment.</p>
        <p>The company culture is casual, but formal when necessary. It has a small company feel, and it is a company that takes care of its employees, </p>
        <p>The image of the company is of a solid, functional, ultra high technology, telecommunications business, able to rapidly adapt to business situations. The staff are highly skilled and highly motivated. It could be described as the Volvo of the business; high quality and reliable, yet relatively low cost. </p>
        <p>The company's products and services are highly technical. They are customized for each client. It is anticipated the visitor to the web site will already be somewhat conversant with the language of the business. </p>
        <p>The site should give the impression of a leading edge, high technology, state of the art company. It is also a friendly, efficient company, easy to deal with, a company you could depend on. It is a company that is open for business, is keen to secure your business and will do anything to keep your business. </p>
        <p>The site is largely a marketing tool, aimed at impressing and informing the visitor, and allowing the visitor to easily contact the company. The site should be easy to use, quickly yet fully informative, without complexity and clutter. </p>
        <p>Due to the meteoric and fascinating rise of the company, the web site must include a section detailing the company's history. Pictures will be made available to add to the site.</p>
        <p>To emphasize the high technology nature of the company I propose to use some high technology features on the site, for example a movie. Possible themes include hardware, high tech workers at work and network diagrams.</p>
        <p>I will now research some web sites looking for some examples for our next meeting. It is hoped these sites will provoke some thoughts and better provide an image of the client's requirements.</p>
