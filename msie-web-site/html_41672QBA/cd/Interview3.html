      <p>I have just completed an interview with the client to discuss some web sites I had chosen. </p>
          <p>Specifically, I was attempting to discover what the client meant by the keywords leading edge, high technology, state of the art, high quality, dependable, friendly, low cost and meteoric growth. </p>
          <p>Also, I wanted to discover whether any of these keywords were actually not important. and to determine the relative importance of these keywords in relation to each other. </p>
  </div>
      <div class="story">
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <h2>Client Interview </h2>
        <p>I presented each of the three sites in turn. For each page of each site, I asked the client for an impression of the page, a feeling, along with his thoughts. At first the answers were slow in coming but as the process proceeded, the thoughts were rather more fluid.</p>
        <h2>DRS Technologies</h2>
        <p>The client felt this site was leading edge, state of the art, very business like. It had products to sell (and was going to sell them come what may). It is very bright and high energy. It says &quot;Here we are, grab us&quot;. He liked the subdued imagery on the left of the second page. He liked the two pages together more than the first page alone. </p>
        <p>However, the main page was stark, the colors too vivid, too bright, the wartime scene not helping. The black border gave it some teeth, without which the site looks much more subdued. It does not say  friendly and nor does it say  small company.</p>
        <h2>Lockheed Martin</h2>
        <p>The client likes the first page, in particular as it conveys hi tech and state of the art. The  representation of the network is particularly apt as &quot;this is  exactly what we do&quot;, and &quot;all at our fingertips&quot;. The client likes the contrast., the color palette and in particular the choice of blues. He finds the overall image very pleasing, down to business, very professional and organized. This is a company that has it's stuff together. </p>
        <p>However, the client felt the imagery conveyed a feeling that  may be a little too stiff.</p>
        <h2>Sonix Technologies</h2>
        <p>The client  liked the second page. It is subdued but still looks high tech and state of the art. It's color scheme, layout and contrast he found very pleasing. The pages convey a feeling of being lower cost but not low cost. </p>
        <p>However, the first page he found too bright, with far too much contrast, the color scheme being mostly responsible. It is too flashy, too young, too much like a video game, almost garish. He felt the other sites looked more professional. Interestingly, he stated that different shades may be just fine, causing me to think that I need to choose another site to test his concept of pleasing. </p>
        <h2>Ratings</h2>
        <p>I asked the client to rate each page on each of the following heuristics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>State of the Art </li>
          <li>Quality</li>
          <li>Friendly</li>
          <li>Fast Growth</li>
          <li>Low Cost</li>
          <li>Overall</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ratings are for 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest. </p>

            <td><div align="center">N/A</div></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>I then asked the client for his overall ratings of the sites. Again, ratings are for 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest.</p>
        <table width="100%"  border="5" cellspacing="10">
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">&nbsp;</th>
            <th scope="col">DRS Technology </th>
            <th scope="col">Lockheed Martin </th>
            <th scope="col">Sonix Technologies </th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">Overall Rating </th>
            <td><div align="center">6</div></td>
            <td><div align="center">9</div></td>
            <td><div align="center">5</div></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The client, when quizzed about the low cost issue admits that this is not an issue. It has dropped off of the list of keywords. </p>
        <p>The client expressed the view that his image of friendly is one of people working together.</p>
        <h2>Summary    </h2>
        <p>I think I am not clear as to what is pleasing to the client. This is going to require some research. </p>
        <p>I think I have established some very valuable guidelines for the design process. I think I now need to focus some attention on the balance between state of the art and quality on the one hand, and friendly on the other. It appears that I need to test the client with some designs whose friendliness bounds the Lockheed Martin and Sonix Technologies pages. I strongly suspect that the balance the client is looking for is only slightly more friendly than the Lockheed Martin site, a less buttoned up image being the target.</p>
