        <p>Based on the card sort and user scenarios you've done you should do the following: </p>
        <p>1) make a list of navigation questions you have. Examples: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>should you have a “for students”, and a “for faculty” section </li>
          <li>should you have “tuition” in the main navigation </li>
          <li>should you list all the programs that the College offers? </li>
          <li>Should you make a distinction between undergraduate and graduate classes? </li>
        </ul>
        <p>2) highlight any wording you're not sure about? Examples: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>About Us / About / History </li>
          <li>Financial Aid / Costs / Tuition </li>
          <li>Make a list of content questions you have on home page. For example: should you show the latest news on the home page? </li>
          <li>Make a list of questions that your key users might have when coming to the site. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="A1_1" id="A1_1"></a>Card Sort Review </h1>
        <p><a href="c3_0.html#CD_2">I have produced another card sort.</a> The original probably had too many top level categories for the home page, making that page hard for anyone to quickly spot the route to their goal. The new card sort will probably make the home page easier to read, and quicker to use for some, but will probably hinder other users.</p>
        <h4>Essentially, the design becomes a compromise. I need to keep in mind the following keys:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>University Mission Statement.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Web Site Users and their Goals.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>What works for the Client. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The User Groups are:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Prospective Student</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Current Student</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Parents</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Alumni</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Faculty</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Media</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Researchers</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Corporate</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Staff</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Local community</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Job Seeker</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Curious Users</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For a full listing of user groups and their goals, <a href="users.html#U1_2">click here.</a> </p>
        <p>The search engine user group has been dropped from the list for the moment, as I do not have enough information regarding this user group. </p>
        <p>The compromise needs to maximally facilitate the keys. Facilitating the keys and the compromised appears to be a considerable challenge.</p>
        <h1><a name="A1_2" id="A1_2"></a>Navigation Questions </h1>
        <p>I plan to use the<a href="c3_0.html#CD_2"> Design 2 card sort</a> as the basis for the project. With far fewer links, I feel this design is more expandable than the <a href="users.html#U1_4">original</a> and the <a href="c3_0.html#CD_1">modified original.</a> If the usability testing reveals the need for additional links, I plan to alter the card sort appropriately.</p>
        <h2>Navigation Questions:</h2>
        <p>I really don't know how far to go with this. I would think the whole  card sort needs to be examined in detail, but this exercise seems to be limited to just the home page. I thus limit my attentions to issues regarding the home page. </p>
        <p>The keys here are to provide easy navigation to the user groups that no longer have an obvious link on the home page, and to ensure that all user groups can intuitively navigate the home page. Does the user understand how the site is organized, how it works? Do the keywords make sense?</p>
        <p>The aim of the wireframe exercise is to look for what is missing,  for what is not clear, sollicit suggested improvements, remove navigation problems before they become embedded into the design of the page. </p>
        <p>All answers should be followed by the why question, when appropriate. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4> What sort of organization do you think this home page is for? What is the purpose of the site? </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>For each of my key user groups, verify that the link for them is obvious. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Would a parent choose Prospective Students? Do parents need their own nav? </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Should Staff/Faculty be separate categories?</h4>
          </li>
          <li>Do I need a Help item on the home page? If a user cannot find what he is looking for, what would he do next? Why? Why could he not find what he was looking for? What did I miss? </li>
          <li>A media user would need to start with The University. Is this obvious? Where should this link be. Why? </li>
          <li>A Job Seeker user would need to start with The University. Is this obvious? Where should this link be? Why?</li>
          <li>A local community user  would need to start with Quick Links. Is this obvious? Where should this link be? Why? </li>
          <li>What information would each user group expect to find in the Quick Links? Why? </li>
          <li>Need to ensure that all of the prospective student types know to start with the aptly named link. Is it obvious? Why? </li>
          <li>Where would a High School Teacher, researching UG courses, navigate to? Why? Any suggestions? </li>
          <li>Would a high school student intuitively understand the term prospective student? Is there another term? Why? </li>
          <li>What would you do and why would you do it? How could it be improved? </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wording Questions:</h2>
        <p>Look for words that do not make sense, or which could be improved. Words need to be obvious, the user should instantly recognize the words and be able to instantly act on them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Is it Prospective or Future Students? </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Should I use Graduates or Alumni or Both? If both, Graduates/Alumni? What? Why? </h4>
          </li>
          <li>Should I use Staff or Faculty or Both? If both, Staff/Faculty, Faculty/Staff? What? Why?</li>
          <li>Is corporate the right word? Maybe Business would be better. </li>
          <li>Is Quick Links the right term? What does that mean to the user? What word(s) would the user expect to see? Why? </li>
          <li>Should it be The University, or About The University, or About Us, or what?</li>
          <li>Should I show the latest news on the home page? </li>
          <li>Should it be media or press? </li>
          <li>Should it be Home? Or The University? Or what? Why? </li>
          <li>Local community or Neighbors? </li>
        </ul>
