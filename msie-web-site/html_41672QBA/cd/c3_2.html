        <h1><a name="TOP" id="TOP"></a>Assignment</h1>
        <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
        <h3>Create 3 Wireframes </h3>
        <p>You should make 3 different wireframes. These wireframes should be created so that you can test all of your questions above. Here are some guidelines: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>These are best if done with pen and paper </li>
          <li>one of them should only have a few links (10 or less) </li>
          <li>one of them should have a lot of links (20+) </li>
          <li>They should all be as different as possible. For instance one might show news on the home page. One might have a testimonial on the home page. One might have a huge picture </li>
          <li>One should have navigation based on your card sort </li>
          <li>The headings of areas should be exemplary. For instance one should say “Welcome” and another should say “News” or “Highlights” or “What's New?”. </li>
          <li>Images should be SIMPLE. I usually simply make a box with an X through it. </li>
          <li>Text can be represented with squiggly lines </li>
          <li>For 1 or 2 of these you might want to just pick 2 existing sites, and turn them into wireframes. At least one of them should be based on your cards sort and user scenarios though. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test your Wireframes on 1 – 3 “sample users” </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Have 10-15 questions ready ahead of time </li>
          <li>Make it clear that there are no right or wrong answers. We're testing the design, not the testers </li>
          <li>Ask people to think out loud </li>
          <li>Be sure to ask them WHY they thought something </li>
          <li>While it's sometimes useful to ask what catches their interest on the site, it's often more important to ask them specific tasks (examples below) </li>
          <li>Try not to give hints about what you hope they will do. For example, don't use the same word in your question that appears in the navigation. (Example: if a button is labeled "contact", instead of "Where would you go to find out how to contact the company?" ask "How might you get in touch with the company?" or "What is the company's phone number?") </li>
          <li>Let them know that you can answer all of their questions at the end, but during the test, you may not be able to answer some of them because they may bias their actions while taking the test. </li>
          <li>It's much more important to test these on anyone, than it is to test them on the right people. Most of the questions we're going to ask are based on common sense and initial perceptions. </li>
          <li>Test your questions yourself on your wireframes </li>
          <li>Try not to lead your questions. For instance instead of asking “If you wanted to know more about the history of the school, what link would you click on.”, ask “Your parents are paying for your undergraduate degree. Your dad wants you to apply to Ivy League Schools. You're very interested in this school, but you don't think your dad would pay for it. If you were just browsing the site, what would you click on? </li>
          <li>Feel free to use a pencil to change things midway through the test </li>
          <li>You should read chapters 9 and 10 in Don't Make Me Think before doing your testing. </li>
          <li>Each test should take 10-20 minutes. </li>
          <li>Ideally, your test subjects should ideally NOT know a lot about the site you're testing. If they know about the site, they will be biased. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Wireframe Notes </h1>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>My research has led me to the following conclusions:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>No site I visited has entirely followed the conventions.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>No site exactly does it for me.</li>
          <li>No site has solved the compromise problem - they are all compromises.</li>
          <li>Navigation is a problem to some extent on all of the sites. There are no easy answers.</li>
          <li>Many sites clutter the home page trying to display too much information. </li>
          <li>They are all effective to some extent.</li>
          <li>They largely rely on images to portray a sense of who they are.</li>
          <li>I now know enough to be dangerous!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I see no point proceeding to wireframes without a clear design in mind. I have thus formulated a basic design for the site which I plan to build around. My wireframes will be designed to help me to tweak that design. </p>
        <h4>My main concern is to determine how to best present the navigation items. I plan to use the conventions as outlined in Don't Make Me Think.</h4>
        <p>I will build wireframes with only the navigation items present. The rest of the page will be made vague. </p>
        <p>It is clear to me that the number of categories drives the design. My card sort with some 20 categories requires a design that is very different from the design I have in mind. I will build a wireframe that will handle such a large number of categories just to see what happens. I have thus decided to use both of the new card sorts! </p>
        <h1>Notes for the Interview Process </h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>The following are some basic notes regarding the interview process.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>For a useful test I will ask 3-4 people to be test subjects. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Prepare the test carefully. Know what I am trying to test and script the questions accordingly. Allow a broad scope for questions as I don't know how any person will respond, and I don't know where the tests will lead.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Run the tests against myself before inflicting them on others. A quick sanity check.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Start with some small talk, try to put us all at ease.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Tell the testers what to expect, tell them there are no right or wrong answers, this is not to test them, but to test some ideas. Ask them to think out loud. Always be nice to them.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Watch people as they try to use the wireframes and note where they run into trouble. Note reactions, words, thoughts.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Thank the tester when the test is done. </h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Interview 1 </h1>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>The user groups were fairly easy to identify. This tester is used to looking for things on web sites.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>She found wireframes 1 and 2 just too hard to use. She scans top to bottom, the design of 1 and 2 are top, left, bottom, some in the middle. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Wireframe 3 she found very easy to use. It is designed like an outline, she doesn't have to move all over the screen to get there. The navigation works just right for her. She found the user types easily, the information types with no problem. The design is less busy. </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>She thought visitors referred to visiting professors and students. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Business refers to business at the college.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Corporate refers to corporations working with the college.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Neighbors refers to an Outreach Program.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Local Community  refers to an Outreach Program. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Media and Press both mean the University in the News.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>About Essex University means a brief description of the University, maybe some history.....</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Quick Links did not mean anything to her.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>She liked the contact us, she wants to be able to talk  to someone. </h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Interview 2 </h1>
        <p>This tester, I felt during the testing, was a little too initiated into web site design. He knew basically what he should be looking for, as if he had some right answers and was looking for them in the design. As the session wore on, I felt he let that slide to one side, allowing himself to consider the designs based on his own thoughts.</p>
        <p>The user groups were fairly easy to identify but this tester, although able to find the correct item for the users groups, always followed that with a list of other potential options. He sounded to me to be a bit of a browser, experienced in finding the content but used to having to poke around to find it. Very patient, or putting on a show for me. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>He found wireframe 3 to be succinct, simple, to have logical components. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireframe 2 is more artistic, more graphically pleasing. The same info, more conventional, more condensed.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>He prefers wireframe 2 over 1. A better arrangement.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Visitors is confusing. Try Campus Visitors. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Business is confusing. Try Business Relationships.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Corporate is confusing.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Just use Alumni. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Quick Links refers to all links on the site. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>About Essex University means a brief description of the University, maybe some history.....Try The University. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Neighbors is confusing. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Local Community is clear.</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>By the end of the test, the tester was utterly convinced that wireframe 3 was far easier to use, the navigation being so much simpler. Wireframes 1 and 2 struck him as cluttered, it sometimes not being immediately obvious where to find things. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h1>Interview 3 </h1>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>This tester claimed to know nothing about the internet. Actually, he is just a naturally modest guy, who works with his hands and feels inferior around computers.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>I noticed that he naturally addresses questions and issues from the viewpoint of others, as well as his own. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>It quickly became clear that, as he uses the web frequently, he is anything but a know nothing. He knows how he uses the web, what he expects to see, where things should be for him. He likes to get in there, get what he wants and get out. This all sounded familiar, just if only I could remember who, only a month or so ago, muttered such familiar words.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>He preferred wireframe 3 as it is so simple to see, easy to use, simple to navigate. There is no added flair. It could be more visually engaging. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireframe 2 has the same topics, they are across the top, left, center, bottom - he has to hunt and search. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireframe 1 is easier to use than 2 as there is less going on.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireframes 1 and 2 are newspaper type sites.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>Business is confusing. Business relations means working with local businesses.</li>
          <li>Visitors means visitors to the University.</li>
          <li>Quick Links; usually an in-depth view of where you want to go, a list of all links.</li>
          <li>About Essex University again does not work.</li>
          <li>Use Local Community.  </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Some sites, he said, have too much going on. Some are like a newspaper. You have to jump around to find things, they are cluttered, they have a newspaper format. They lack continuity, They are hard to read. A smart guy for someone who knows nothing!!! </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h1>Conclusions </h1>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>And now for the reason for all of this work:</h4>
        <ul><li><h4>Wireframe 3 is preferred as it is easy to use. The navigation items are easy to find, they are in two top to bottom lines which are easy for the eye to scan. The category names are easy to decode.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The wireframe 3 design allows for the 20+ categories card sort. It allows for easier user type navigation. It is relatively expandable. It is not pretty, but it is not supposed to be. It's looks could doubtless be improved with some color etc... </h4>
          </li>
          <li>Use Business Relations.</li>
          <li>Use Alumni.</li>
          <li>Use Local Community.</li>
          <li>Use Visitors to the University.</li>
          <li>Use Media.</li>
          <li>About Essex University needs to be broken up into more logical components.</li>
          <li>Quick Links is a useful link.</li>
          <li>Site Map A-Z is liked.</li>
          <li>If the user gets stuck, they all go to the search or to the site map.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Comments</h1>
        <p>It is astonishing to me to see just how initiated the testers are into the experience of using the web. They are actually amazingly skilled, even those who claim to know nothing. They understand why and how they use the web, they understand how they look for their quarry, what to do if it does not immediately appear, where everything should be, how a web site should look, when a web site does not work for them, when a page is too cluttered, when words do not make sense or do not belong. They know how they scan the page, they know what they are scanning for, where it should  and should not be, and how a page should be structured to be easy for them to use. </p>
        <h4>My first two wireframes were designed to test my design ideas.They are built around card sort 2.</h4>
        <p>Wireframe 3 is built around the modified card sort 1. With 20 categories on the home page, I had to choose a different design. I chose the basic design of the current Essex University Web Site, partly because I could make it work with 20+ categories, but also because I wanted to discover what it is about their web site that I found to be so good. This was the reason for choosing to work with their site in the first place, and so this opportunity was just too good to pass up. </p>
        <h4>While it is not wise to draw too many conclusions from the assignment, some things are clear:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Everything I thought I knew was wrong. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Can I really ever think like a real user?</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>This is tough.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Words are not obvious. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>Words without a context mean anything to anyone. </li>
          <li>My designs fail to take into account that the user has a context in which words are defined, designs are prejudged, imagery predetermined. </li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="Lessons" id="Lessons"></a>Lessons Learned </h1>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>The following are some lessons learnt during the assignment: </h4>
        <ul><li><h4>It is very hard to determine how to compromise between availability and usability. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Making links specifically available for all user groups does not necessarily mean that each user group will be able to navigate to their goals.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> It would be possible to create a mess that satisfies nobody. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Trying to satisfy everyone will probably create a site that has no real appeal. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Where are the lines? Where should I compromise? What is the price of each compromise? How do I reduce the price of a compromise?</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Usability testing is a way of determining what works, to answer the questions regarding compromise. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Usability testing like this can be done easily, quickly and at any time. Thus, can start usability testing a basic design, to tune it, and continue to test all pages throughout the development process. Will hopefully flush out more problems quicker and earlier in the development process, thus reducing the development costs of the project.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>To discover some truths about my designs, I need to get help from others.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Usability Testing is a structured way of getting input from others, answers to questions and also questions to answers.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The wireframes are not drawn to scale. It is thus possible to frame out a page that is actually impossible to build with HTML and/or not possible due to page size limitations. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>I essentially created a grid, major categories across the top, items within each category down the left side. An information grid. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The information must be transformed into some organization or it will surely be hard to find. I like the concept of a grid, as it is familiar and relatively easy to follow.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>The data in the grid can be presented in almost any way, it can even hide the fact that it's a grid. </h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>The following are lessons learnt as the end of the assignment:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>The data is not a grid. While I could model the data as a grid, it is not how users perceive it.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>While I can model a site as a grid, the users have no concept or experience of that. Such a design would fail.</li>
          <li>
            <h4>As the designer, I am not capable of seeing beyond my own design, a design that solves all problems for someone just like me!</h4>
          </li>
          <li>Users like a very simple interface, where navigation is easy. </li>
          <li>Words have a context. Either make that context clear, or users will make one up.</li>
          <li>It takes a little time for the user to create a context </li>
          <li>The user defined context will result in undefined consequences.</li>
          <li>The site needs to have a perspective. I guess that is where imagery comes into play.</li>
          <li>Content is king. The user places far more value on easily getting what he wants than on anything else.</li>
          <li>Interestingly, my competitive review stated something like that. The relative ease with which I found my information was the primary scoring determinator.</li>
          <li>I have come to understand that there are user types and there are information types. When I mixed them up, the users got confused. </li>
          <li>Just when I think I have a clearer view of what works and does not work, something happens, and it turns out I do not. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The next assignment should be to design and build wireframes based around the concept of user groups and information groups. During my research into different designs, I came across the web site of <a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University. </a>At the time I thought it to be simplistic, yet effective, but surely far too low key for such a prestiguous University. However, it's grouping by <strong>information for</strong> and <strong>information about </strong>provides a context, a distinction for the categories. It is surprisingly clear and well worth exploring more. </p>
