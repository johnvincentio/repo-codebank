        <h3>More beauty </h3>
        <p>We've all heard Mike's description of a beautiful experience in class. Your job will be to find ways to convey those same feelings. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Find a web site which conveys those feelings. Please have your web site posted by chat on October 22th </li>
          <li>Find a piece of music that conveys this experience. Turn that music into an MP3 (if you don't know how, ask any teenager) and email it to me by chat on Oct 22th. </li>
          <li>Find a picture (in a magazine or a book) which conveys these feelings, and bring it with you to class. Please bring a PHYSICAL copy of the image. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Beauty Description </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Worked all day </li>
          <li>Get to the summit </li>
          <li>Rewarding </li>
          <li>Before Dusk </li>
          <li>Quiet </li>

          <li>A part of something </li>
          <li>Close friends </li>
          <li>Time and energy </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Beauty Tips </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>When finding web sites, don't choose flash sites (with sound and animation). We'll talk more about flash later, but there are many usability pitfalls that makes Flash impractical for many web sites.</li>
          <li>Don't be too literal when looking for your images and web sites. Avoid the industry that the client is in whenever possible. When you start thinking of these exercises too literally you can often find yourself stuck in someone else's rut, instead of making improvements. </li>
          <li>Put yourself in someone else's shoes. Try to understand the impressions that other people will have to the pictures you've selected. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>My Choices </h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>I chose the following web site because I thought the storyline was perfect. Some old friends, hiking through some of the most beautiful scenery imaginable, such incredible hard work, but the reward it quite magnificent. They actually have visual records of several hikes, I am about ready to book an airline ticket! </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp; </h4>
        <blockquote>
          <h4>Utah Pictures <a href="http://utahpictures.com/Lone_Peak_Summit.html">http://utahpictures.com/Lone_Peak_Summit.html</a></h4>
          <h4> and<a href="http://utahpictures.com/LonePeak.html"> http://utahpictures.com/LonePeak.html</a></h4>
          <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        </blockquote>
        <h4>I would like to mention a charity climb of Kilimanjaro, <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/gagnons5/pictures.htm"> http://hometown.aol.com/gagnons5/pictures.htm</a>. The cause is cancer, the climb for one person a memorial to his mother. The pictures are also magnificent, but this site is more about the people, the story, the shared sacrifices. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>When thinking about the magnificence, beauty and splendor of nature, I cannot help but think of the wonders of God. Sitting at the summit, literally and figuratively of a hard earned endeavor, spent from the rigors of the trip, yet relaxed and at peace, with oneself and with the world, only music of true beauty would suffice. I  have thus chosen a piece by JS Bach, namely <a href="Js%20Bach%20-%20Jesu,%20Joy%20Of%20Man%27s%20Desiring.mp3">Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring</a>. To me, celebrating God, the beauty of nature, and the magnificence of this work, with my friends, would be an experience for ever in my memory.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Is the lesson basically that I need to learn how to provoke thoughts and 
  feelings in other people with what and how I present my site? A variation on 
  an earlier lesson that I provide software that people like me understand. <br />
  <br />
  I watched a few ads on TV last night. I normally ignore those things. 
  Interestingly, they all show people doing things, sometimes miserable with 
  someone else's product, oh so delighted with this wonderful product. No ad 
  showed a picture of a mountain. <br />
  <br />
  Isn't this basically a big mental game? Figuring out how to play with 
  peoples minds? Not to change their minds, necessarily,  
  but trying to take advantage of, or use, peoples thinking (or is it reacting) 
  processes to cause a desired reaction (or maybe result). <br />
  <br />
  This seems to me to be an adjunct to marketing, how to make a certain 
  impression  of almost any kind, regardless of reality, image is impression, 
  perception is reality. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>The big problem I have with this stuff is that I know 
          that perception is not real, it is vulnerable to manipulation, that if enough is to be gained, there will 
          be endless clever, subtle and well financed attempts to do exactly that. <br />
          <br />
          I resist attempts to play with my mind, attempts at manipulation are 
          quickly, and sometimes vigorously rebuffed. <br />
          <br />
          That same fierce protection of my thinking processes has led me to be 
          straight with others. I will not do to others as I would not have them do to 
          me. <br />
          <br />
          This mind set has made me good at some things but has obviously left me very 
          weak at others. I am a dreadful salesman, and that in a society where you 
          must sell yourself is a terrible liability. <br />
          <br />
          Interesting how the choices we make can have such far reaching consequences. <br />
        </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp; </h4>
        <h4>I think I put myself into the situation as described in the assignment, not too hard really as I've been 
    there before. Working all day, hard work, get to the summit, at dusk, beauty all 
    around, good friends, at peace.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp; </h4>
        <h4>I chose images that were appropriate 
          to how I felt, what I thought, thus my choices appealed to me in that 
          situation, and doubtless to some others too. The assignment actually is  more abstract, the 
          situation is a backdrop, the assignment, I think, was to evoke those 
          feelings/thoughts/reactions in others, by  visual or musical means, the 
        exact situation not being the key.</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>That is not what I understood, but the 
          exercise is still interesting, in that I note once again, that I make 
          presentation choices based on what I like, or on what would evoke the 
          required response in me.<br />
                </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>I think my choice of music is much the same as my choice of pictures; beautiful and wonderful for someone just like me.  Is  the music  beautiful, or do I think it's appropriate for the emotions that Michael described? </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>It is both, but for whom? If the desired result is to affect a 
          population of people just like me I would be tremendously successful. 
          However, I believe that is not the case. For others, my success rate will 
          probably be low! <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Lesson learnt: I need to consider my audience.</strong></h4>
