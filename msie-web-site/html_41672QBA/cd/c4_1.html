        <h4>List 3 possible ideas for what you would like to do for your final design project. You should put these in order based on your interest (favorite first). Each project should have a short 1-2 sentence description of what you'd like to do, and then one sentence saying WHY you want to do that project. In chat next week we will go over all of your choices and finalize your decisions. Everyone must have a final site chosen and approved by either me or Jen by next Friday Oct 31st. </h4>
        <p>Here are some thoughts to keep in mind when picking a project: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pick something that you can have fun with, and use it as a welcome break, or pick something that really pushes you where you need to go. </li>
          <li>Pick something that you don't know anything about, and learn something new, or pick something that you know pretty well, which you'll be able to take to a new level of mastery. </li>
          <li>Pick something that ties in with another class to kill two birds with one stone, or pick something that is very different from your other classes, to give you a break. </li>
          <li>Work on a potential capstone idea to flush it out a little more and see if you really want to do that for a capstone, or to get a head start on your capstone, or maybe do something really different that you won't have time to do once you start on your capstone. </li>
          <li>You have 7 weeks to complete this project, so be sure to pick a project that you can get a good chunk of work done on in this timeframe. </li>
          <li>You shouldn't have a “client” for your site. If at the end of 7 weeks you have something you want to show to someone, great, but having a “client” can mean a lot of meetings, and limitations that you shouldn't let yourself get bogged down with. </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>First, some comments: </h4>
<ul>
          <li>
            <h4>My future lies in B2B.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> I am not a graphic artist and I never will be. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>My skills lie in the backend stuff. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>I need to get going with developing my J2EE and Web Services skills. </h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>I plan to use this project to force me to get on with these studies.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>I plan to coordinate this project with the Java class.</li>
          <li>I plan to keep the graphic part to a minimum.</li>
          <li>Usability would be very important, the users may not be that computer literate. </li>
      <li>This is a practical project, it will develop and exercise some skills that I must develop anyway.</li>
          <li>I do not need to have a completed product.</li>
          <li>The screen and navigation will need to be complete.</li>
          <li>Some data processing code will not be complete.</li>
          <li>Some data processing screens will not be complete  </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>An  inventory system, maybe for a factory. (No bar codes, maybe later). The system will record ingoing and outgoing movements of all items. When an item gets low, below a threshold, the system will ask the suppliers of the item for bids. Add a supplier portal etc.....the sky is the limit. Would probably be light on security. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h2>Why </h2>
<h4> <br />
          This is a B2B problem which will force me to learn a ton very quickly. The skills and the experience will be on the money. This may be the beginnings of a capstone project. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
    <h4>An online art gallery or photography store. It would be graphic in some way, a chance for me to see what I have learnt! The project would be largely backend, just online shopping. I could provide a supplier portal and an HR portal. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h2>Why </h2>
    <h4>&nbsp;  </h4>
        <h4>It would basically be a B2C application, but it would be fun, and still be very useful. I would have to learn a lot of JSP, XML and EJB as well as continue to develop some artistic skills. </h4>
        <h4><br />
        </h4>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4>Realtime cheat locater. Choose a cheat, let's say fraudelent driving licenses. Make an application that parses disparate information that is spread out in mulitple databases, pulls it altogether and spots a cheat. The application would involve many facets as there are many different users types involved. </h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h2>Why </h2>
        <h4> <br />
  This is a typical B2B problem which I expect to be encountering in the near future. The skills I would acquire designing and developing this solution would help to pay the bills for years. </h4>
