        <h2><a name="FW" id="FW"></a>Foreword</h2>
        <p>For this project, I originally chose an Inventory System, loosely based on an apparel distribution business. </p>
        <p>However, it quickly became clear to me that I have very little to say about inventory systems. I am much more interested in the ideas, concepts and technologies that facilitate an interface between different applications, allowing the real-time usage of data between incompatible systems. </p>
        <p>Most businesses of today have multiple software packages performing largely separate tasks on systems that are largely incompatible. These systems may be internal or external to a business as the effects are the same, namely considerable limits on the ability of the software to perform business essential tasks. The solutions to these limitations involve people providing that interface, usually requiring a considerable human involvement, usually introducing a lot of human error. </p>
        <p>This is an example of people providing the technology. Software should be the technology; it should provide the smarts, leaving people to perform human related tasks. </p>
        <p>Some businesses have attempted to solve the problems by buying an integrated suite of products. These tend to very expensive to purchase, implement and maintain. </p>
        <p>To a business, the software application is a subsystem to the business. They don't know and don't care about incompatible systems. If they are incompatible, they shouldn't be! </p>
        <p>I am most keen to examine the implications of the advent of web services. It is not the technology per se that interests me. It is what can be done with it, and what are the consequences. </p>
        <p>The true promise of web services is that independent, unrelated software packages can be integrated without having to make big changes to any package. Thus applications behave as modules or subsystems within the context of a business's business software solution. Hands off software interactions could change the way we think, and most surely the software we buy. </p>
        <p>An opportunity for me is to produce a package that performs various tasks, and interface with other products to perform other tasks. This looks to me to be a brave new world, full of opportunities for those who are willing to make the journey. </p>
        <p>I thus chose to consider a distribution business and to design software to address its needs. I created a fictional business called Advanced Products Manufacturing or APM, and characters who perform key roles within APM. I identified their goals and attempted to understand their interactions with the software through the creation of stories. </p>
        <p>This led me to design a product around the concept of roles. A role is identified by a group of tasks, for example Sales. Human users (or just users) would be assigned their own login object to gain access to the system, their user name providing access to subsystems through the belonging to a role or roles. </p>
        <p>An interesting consequence of this design is that there is no need for the application to have a single point of entry. In fact, there is no single application, or rather, there doesn't need to be. This is not the case in traditional application design. </p>
        <p>Control of the user through the use of his roles leads to the next interesting thought. Each user's interface needs to be dynamic, adjusting at least somewhat to his capabilities, as well as his needs as identified by his goals. This also flies in the face of traditional software design as well as creating a number of challenges. </p>
        <p>If the user interface were dynamic, defining and controlling that interface would create serious development problems. Testing a user interface is always very hard and incredibly time consuming. A dynamic user interface would test the professionalism, to say nothing of the resolve, of even the most patient and skilled tester. </p>
        <p>It would appear then, that the dynamic interface will require some design gymnastics, and doubtless some compromises, if a design is to be successful. </p>
        <p>Despite the difficulties, I chose this approach because I wanted to see where it might lead, to learn what I can, to determine the issues and to maybe even resolve them. </p>
        <p>The user interface issues results in the need to design the business intelligence into the back end. I propose to implement much of the business intelligence user interface as an alerts subsystem. </p>

        <h2><a name="PG" id="PG"></a>Goals</h2>
        <p>Some goals for this project are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design business subsystems for a Web Services environment. </li>
          <li>Design an inventory system as one of those subsystems. </li>
          <li>Obtain useful skills. </li>
          <li>Gain valuable experience in the design and building of a web based application. </li>
          <li>Learn as much as I can about conceptual design. </li>
          <li>Learn how to design solutions based on intelligent tasking. </li>
          <li>The project should be a cross section of what I need to learn. </li>
          <li>Define the interface and dependencies to other software. </li>
          <li>Start to climb the Web Services mountain. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some goals for the product are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage the inventory of a small to medium sized business. </li>
          <li>Provide required functionality for the key user groups. </li>
          <li>Provide an interface to other software packages. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>
        <h2><a name="STRATEGY" id="STRATEGY"></a>Strategy</h2>
        <p>Employ a top down approach, starting with the role types. Model tasks as objects, modularized and encapsulated. Define the interfaces, noting where the interface is external. The end result should be pieces that fit together and look like one. </p>
        <p><a href="#TOP">Top</a></p>
        <h2><a name="ASSUMPTIONS" id="ASSUMPTIONS"></a>Assumptions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have assumed throughout that the application would be browser based. This is because I wanted to discover, through the design of a product, the issues relating to the development of such an application in the browser environment. The designs will also work in a traditional GUI environment, doubtless made prettier and a lot more functional, but would work much the same anyway. I have further assumed the application would not be an applet, although it could be, for the same reasons as above. </li>
          <li>The designs assume that many businesses use old equipment, and so the browser version may be old. </li>
          <li>As an aid to the design process, I have assumed that many items would be implemented as objects. For example, Login, Name, Address, Alerts, Tracking. They will need to be defined at some point in the design process, but they would be implemented as objects in any case. </li>
          <li>I have assumed the product needs to be localizable. The choice of an Address object is a consequence of that, as is not keying off strings. </li>
          <li>It is expected that many of the users of the system will be relative computer novices. The user interface will need to be simple and easy to use. </li>
          <li>I have assumed no particular market for the product and so the designs need to be easily adapted to other businesses. I thus need a generalized solution. </li>
          <li>All items entering or leaving the warehouse are marked with a barcode consistent with have a predetermined barcode system. </li>
          <li>All suppliers, manufacturers and retailers use the same barcode system. </li>
          <li>The barcode will live with the item until a paying customer removes it. </li>
          <li>I have assumed a web services interface to other systems. These include accounting and shipment tracking systems which are probably internal systems, and also to suppliers, manufacturers and retailers that are not. I have defined each interface as a Web Services Object, thus delaying the precise definition of these interfaces until I have a better understanding of the capabilities of the technology. </li>
          <li>The designs and documents are not complete, nor are they intended to be. If the project were to be taken to the next step, the designs would need to be completed, all issues and inconsistencies resolved, the documentation completed. </li>
          <li>I am clear that I do not currently possess the skills necessary to understand exactly what can be implemented as a user interface in a browser. From a quick peek at next terms books, I think this knowledge will be coming soon. </li>
          <li>My knowledge of databases is not sufficient to determine the design, and maybe the feasibility of some database objects</li>
        </ul>

    <h2><a name="REQUIREMENTS" id="REQUIREMENTS"></a>Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage the inventory of a business. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Record all transactions </li>
          <li>Record all item movements. </li>
          <li>Conduct thorough error checking. </li>
          <li>Ensure the integrity of the data. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Suppliers provide inventory items. </li>
          <li>Items may be distributed to manufacturers, distributors or retailers. </li>
          <li>Items may be distributed as a consignment, which may be returned if not sold. </li>
          <li>Items may be distributed as a sale, to be invoiced later. </li>
          <li>Items may be sold online through the distributors web site. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep track of all inventories. </li>
          <li>Keep track of bids. </li>
          <li>Keep track of orders. </li>
          <li>Keep track of shipments, both entering and leaving. </li>
          <li>Use the company logo and make the product accessible from the company web site. </li>
          <li>The user interface must be clear, simple and easy to use. User training curves must be reduced. </li>
          <li>Each user role interface needs to make it clear who is using the system, and how they use it. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Integrate with an accounting package. </li>
          <li>Provide web services access to its inventory and customer records, as other products will require such access. </li>
          <li>Be consistent with other web services based products. </li>
          <li>Differentiate user types by roles, the roles being limited to their own tasks, accessibility to data controlled by access, and by view. </li>
          <li>There will be a person assigned as the super user role who, it is assumed, will be knowledgeable with regard to the software. </li>
          <li>Recognize different roles and show an appropriate interface for that user. </li>
          <li>Address the needs of each user type, facilitating great user efficiency, and to inform the user of pending issues and problems, all in a user configurable manner. </li>
          <li>All items need to be categorized, that is, all it's properties need to be definable within a constructed environment. For example, for an item that needs to be assigned a color, the list of available colors must be predefined and controlled. </li>
          <li>Properties are to be implemented as Characteristics. They are user configurable, and theoretically infinite. </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>The user interface must be kept simple to program. </li>
          <li>The intelligent part of the system needs to be built into the back end (server). </li>
          <li>A simple interface must connect the user interface with the business logic in the server. </li>
          <li>System configuration issues will be reserved for a user type who it is assumed will be knowledgeable with regard to the product. </li>
          <li>The server subsystem will watch the system. It will issue alerts to the appropriate role(s) for system defined conditions and also for user defined alert conditions. </li>
          <li>Alerts conditions will include inventory item low, shipment late, payment late conditions. </li>
          <li>The alerts system will need to be continually designed during the development phase of the project. </li>
          <li>The supplier via Web Services will upload shipment details before the shipment arrives. </li>
          <li>Only when a transaction has been completed can the related information be archived. </li>
          <li>The archive information and format must be chosen carefully to allow easy access by tax accounting software, marketing and legal software. These issues are beyond the scope of this project. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>A system of this type is a huge undertaking. It is clearly not possible for me to complete the whole product and so, I must carefully create divisions that at least allow me to make some progress towards completing the goals I have set for the project. </p>
        <p>In the interests of time, and my sanity, I have chosen to break down the project into pieces defined by the required roles, plus the role of a super user. </p>

        <h2><a name="COMPETE" id="COMPETE"></a>Competitive Review </h2>
        <p>I have spent many long hours looking for web based inventory systems. There are very few, and they are not available as demo systems. I am thus limited to non-web based systems, many of which are very simplistic. The more sophisticated systems are not available as downloads.</p>
        <p>I could conduct a review of these products but I feel the gain, if any, would not be worth the effort. However, there are some interesting points:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>They are all monolithic applications.</li>
          <li>They have a single interface, which all users need to navigate.</li>
          <li>The interfaces are very cluttered, partly because there is not a recognition that the information being presented is not tailored to the viewer.</li>
          <li>They are not easy to use.</li>
          <li>Once learnt, the systems are probably fairly easy to use, the learning curve being a problem. </li>
          <li>They mostly do not handle multiple concurrency issues.</li>
          <li>They are not hi-tech designs, solutions or implementations.</li>
          <li>They are not web based.</li>
          <li>They do not implement Web Services. I did see an article about a company that implemented a Web Services interface between itself and a supplier. They raved about it. Saved them lots of money, they claimed.</li>
          <li>They usually do not implement a RDBMS. </li>
          <li>To compete, they usually integrate with software from other suppliers. Due to the difficulties of integration, this appears to be as much a liability as an asset. </li>

        <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
        <h2>Page 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Section A </strong>describes the process by which items will be added to the catalog. A note suggests that items should be moved into the catalog from a supplier through a web service. I offer a design to handle both options.</p>
        <p><strong>Section B</strong> describes a bid, offer and contract system. A product manager role user, responding to an item low alert, may deem it necessary to ask for bids to fill the order. First create a package and add items to it from the catalog (C). Add a new bid, complete the details and save (D). Approve the bid request (E). </p>
        <p>(F) and (G) show an advantage of web services. People make the decisions, the software talks to software informing the software of that persons decision. People are not involved in the technology. </p>
        <p>(H) shows the submitted bid event has been detected, the contracts manager role has been informed. Go to Page 2. </p>
        <h2>Page 2 </h2>
        <p>(A) shows the details of a bid. (B) through (F) show the contract being accepted by all parties.</p>
        <p>(G) shows the new contract steps without a bidding process.</p>
        <h2>Page 3 </h2>
        <p>Shows some system related tasks that are reserved for the SuperUser Role.</p>
        <p>(A) shows adding a new Role.</p>
        <p>(B) shows granting a  Role access to a subsystem.</p>
        <p>(C) shows adding a new User.</p>
        <p>(D) suggests some of the configuration tasks that need to be considered.</p>
        <p>(E) and (F) refer to configuring Alerts.</p>
        <h2>Page 4, also contains Page 5 </h2>
        <p>Section 4 refers to shipments. </p>
        <p>(A) shows another advantage of using a Web Service. Shipment information is sent to the receiver of the shipment before the shipment is sent. It is early, it is correct, it is online and people did nothing. The arrival of the data triggers an alert to the Warehouse Manager Role (B).</p>
        <p>(C) and (D) show the warehouse manager looking over the shipment, as he needs to know what will be arriving and when.</p>
        <p>When the shipment arrives, the WarehouseManager Role needs to examine the items (E). </p>
        <p>Items that are accepted (F) need to be placed into the inventory.</p>
        <p>Items that are rejected need to be returned (G) through (J).</p>
        <p>Section 5 suggests a technique for providing access to access permitted subsystems through a dynamic interface. </p>
        <h2>Page 6 </h2>
        <p>This page refers to the inventory subsystem. An interesting thing happened here. An inventory system actually has very little to do with inventory. It is about how items get into inventory, how they go someplace else, how items, money and people are tracked. This is why this page has so little to say, and why some of the other pages are so tough.</p>
        <p>(A) and (B) show items being accepted into the inventory.</p>
        <p>In (C) I was thinking with words, it turns out that most of the functions I thought were Inventory Manager Role tasks are not.</p>
        <p>(D) are some musings on the Product Manufacturing Process. Of particular interest here is that items in the inventory are sent to another location to be manufactured into some other item(s) that are put into the inventory. So when does an item leave an inventory? If an item has been sent for manufacturing, what is it's current state? Where is it? Manufacturing can require multiple steps. The items used in that process must be tracked as they are assets. This suggests a need for a subsystem that understands the manufacturing process, that allows a ManufacturingManager Role person to model the process, to allow for the tracking of the items that are used in those processes. </p>

        <p> (7F) and (7G) refer to shipping the consignment.</p>
        <p>(7H) and (7I) refer to creating a new invoice. Someone wants to buy something. Make an invoice (7I) and add items to the invoice (7J),(7K),(7L). The items will be shipped (7M) much as (7F).</p>

        <p>(B) shows the catalog page.</p>
        <p>(C), (D) and (E) refer to adding a collection, and adding items to the collection.</p>
        <p>(F), (G) and (H) refer to a product group. The idea is that some products are related to others. Maybe they go together, maybe they are required together, or maybe they are commonly sold together. I am not so sure this is a ProductManager Role task. Probably should be moved to the SalesManager.</p>
        <p>(J) talks briefly about the suppliers. Note that a supplier catalog could be imported or retrieved through a web service request.</p>
        <p>(K) and (T) refer to alerts regarding the inventory.</p>

        <h2><a name="PERMISSIONS" id="PERMISSIONS"></a>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Permissions within the application are defined by roles. A role is granted read, write and/or delete access to a subsystem. Further, users are granted a role, or multiple roles, allowing access to that roles access permitted subsystem, with the grants of that role. </p>
        <p>There are roles that are defined by the system, for example SuperUser Role, and roles that are user defined. For example, a role FactorySales could be created with read access to remanufacturing information. A user granted the FactorySales role would thus be permitted access to remanufacturing information.</p>
        <p>This design allows for almost complete control over all users of the application. </p>
        <p>A user called the super user owns the permissions subsystem. The super user: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>has all rights to all parts of all subsystems. </li>
          <li>Assigns permissions to subsystems by roles and/or users. </li>
          <li>Assigns users to roles. </li>
          <li>Assigns permissions to roles and/or to users within those roles. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each user, in effect, has a permissions object. The software will retrieve this object. Menu choices will be determined by the choices available to the user. The user interface will be dynamic and based upon the tasks the user is permitted to perform. </p>
        <p>Available access types are: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read (select) </li>
          <li>Write (read and write) </li>

Probably the OS will have to do this, a cron job could periodically check to see if the /var/lock/serverSystem/pid.lock PID is still running. Would have to email the root user, hopefully he is awake.....</p>

        <ul><li><h4>be careful what you expect from others </h4>
          </li>

          <li>there exists not a mountain that can, from afar, look like a molehill. </li>

            <h4>people are incredibly clever....</h4>

            <h4>brainstorming sessions make the creative process so much easier, and a lot more fun...</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>brainstorming sessions can go almost anywhere as the participants tend to have their own biases, experiences and thoughts.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>design a brainstorming session, decide an issue, decide who to invite, limit the time for each topic. </li>
          <li>I realized, a little late, that I really have very little to say about inventory systems. </li>
          <li>I got myself into a tiz over the inventory system. realized that that was not what i had to say - it is the interwoven relationships of dependent independent businesses, how they interact and how their software will help them do that.</li>
          <li>Extranet - a company's intranet that allows customers access to certain applications within that intranet.</li>
          <li>Must do prep work - always like to avoid this stuff.</li>
          <li>Break down the project into smaller logical pieces. Continue until the pieces are manageable.</li>
          <li>Define each piece, describe how the pieces interact. </li>
          <li>Providing a web based interface for non-computer literate people is asking for trouble. Such people would probably be better off with an environment which is much more closely controlled. </li>
          <li>Researching a market is incredibly time consuming.</li>
          <li>Researching competing products is even more time consuming.</li>
          <li>This work is hard to measure, is what I am doing working, will it lead anywhere, will I get feedback, from whom, when, how, if ever.....</li>
          <li>Pushing around tons of paper is not fun. </li>
          <li>I can draw images illustrating ideas...this is quite easy.</li>
          <li>Turning images into something more concrete, like a specification is very hard.</li>
          <li>I hate writing specs!</li>
          <li>I don't have the skills with graphical tools like Visio to be able to produce decent electronic specs in a sensible amount of time.</li>
          <li>I would rather do something concrete, work with a client, build something for real.</li>
          <li>I had to get away from the how do I display everything. It is just too hard to visualize an interface that is a browser.</li>
          <li>Stick to basic design questions and let the user interface question wait until I know what I need to do.</li>
          <li>What I really needed to do with this project was to work the technology to see what I could do. Knowing what is possible with the technology would allow me to design an application that uses that technology. Without those skills, I find myself guessing too much, and not being able to design on solid ground.</li>
          <li>An inventory system touches on other applications. It is hard to consider one without considering the others.</li>
          <li>These systems are very large, with so many options, they perform so many functions in so many ways. It is hard to get my head around it.</li>
          <li>Work with a real client, someone who understands the requirements of the application. I cannot be the application expert.</li>
          <li>Need lots of input. Competing products need to be examined.</li>
          <li>Using a browser solution is a solution, not the problem. browser may not be the solution.</li>
          <li>To design anything I first need a pretty good understanding of the underlying technologies. </li>
          <li>Without having an understanding of the application, I have had to determine the questions, inside a context of not knowing the answers nor the environment in which this is all taking place.</li>
          <li>It is hard to know where to stop. Every which way I turn I open yet more cans of worms. Must understand the market so I can limit the scope.</li>
          <li>Understand your customer.</li>
          <li>Else, you are building on sand, everything keeps shifting, I cannot focus, cannot complete anything. </li>
          <li>I could easily spend the next two months writing a detailed spec.</li>
          <li>However, it would probably be of limited value as I haven't addressed the market, the customers or the application. </li>
          <li>doesn 't matter how I design the app, I cannot banish the possibility of human error. All I do is move it along.</li>
          <li>the software can only be as good as the people who use it. </li>
          <li> write a checker, scan the system for errors, alerts to anyone who can fix it.</li>
          <li>Different types of errors, alert different tier of management based on the error.</li>
          <li>software that is smarter than the people who use it will not be successful.</li>
          <li> have had to relearn how to design a software solution. Maybe that is what this project was really about for me.</li>
          <li>the time consuming part is figuring out the questions.</li>
          <li>design for localization....note the issues....design around them.</li>
          <li>I feel as if I just took part in a high scoring game of football, which I lost 5-1, in which I scored all 6 goals, not so surprising as I was the only player on the field.</li>
          <li>Without a client, it is just a mental exercise.</li>
          <li>How much do I want to be exercised? That answers the question &quot;How far do I take this?&quot;.</li>
          <li>Trying to model the vast number of possible scenarios becomes bewildering.</li>
          <li>Next term are courses that are aimed at building web applications. Next term I will learn whether this application can be written for a browser.</li>
          <li>The best I can do now is to design the application and present my findings. Maybe next term I will write at least some of it.</li>
          <li>Need a more controlled environment to control the user, to ensure the integrity of the data, that is the business.</li>
          <li>must research the market, the available products, the customers, understand them all, design a solution based on that understanding.....</li>
          <li>interesting to note that I use the human experience to model a problem...visualization tool. </li>
          <li>cannot eliminate human error. For example, edit/delete permissions, could remove an order! The checker can scan the system and a supplier system, via web services, and probably determine there is a problem. But what if there is also a problem with the supplier system? Someone there may have committed a human error. Just cannot design away human error.</li>
          <li>This project scope just keeps creeping along!</li>
          <li>Define where the system starts and where it ends. </li>
          <li>need a client to work with.</li>
          <li>need an expert in the application itself.</li>
          <li>need to define the exact aims and requirements.</li>
          <li>do not allow the scope to change unless required.</li>
          <li>what I learn is not necessarily what I think I will learn. </li>
          <li>I see my technical ideas as great ideas that  I must implement, do all that is necessary. It is not my web site, it is not there for me, or for people just like me. I need to back away and see what thoughts and ideas are provoked in others. It is a choice I must learn to exercise. </li>
          <li>interesting how, at some point during the design process, the screens for different roles started to converge! </li>
          <li>a natural tendency is to design models around the human experience. For example, a package for shipment. I design the software to perform steps very similar to those he would take if he did not have the software. Does this close off more innovative designs? </li>
          <li>I wrote my lessons learned whenever I learnt a lesson. I did so from the beginning of the project. The odd thing is there are very few duplicates in this list. </li>
          <li>this project has been another lesson in the &quot;So you think you know how to do that&quot; series. This time the &quot;that&quot; is design. </li>

        <h2><a name="FINAL" id="FINAL"></a>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>This project may form the backbone of a capstone project, or maybe even a commercial product. Today, I simply do not know enough to be able to determine the future value of this project. However, minimally, I could use this design work as a basis for some interesting development projects to answer some of those questions.</p>
        <p>Even the mighty oak started as an acorn. Whether this project will become an oak or is destined to be eaten by squirrels remains to be seen. </p>
