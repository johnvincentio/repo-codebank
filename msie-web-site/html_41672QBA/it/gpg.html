NAME
       gpg â encryption and signing tool

SYNOPSIS
       gpg  [--homedir name]  [--options file]  [options]  command  [args]

DESCRIPTION
       gpg is the main program for the GnuPG system.

       This  man page only lists the commands and options available.  For more
       verbose documentation get the GNU Privacy Handbook (GPH) or one of  the
       other documents at http://www.gnupg.org/docs.html .

       Please  remember  that  option parsing stops as soon as a non option is
       encountered, you can explicitly stop option parsing by using  the  spe-
       cial option "--".

COMMANDS
       gpg recognizes these commands:

       -s, --sign
                 Make   a   signature.  This  command  may  be  combined  with
                 --encrypt.

       --clearsign
                 Make a clear text signature.

       -b, --detach-sign
                 Make a detached signature.

       -e, --encrypt
                 Encrypt data. This option may be combined with --sign.

       -c, --symmetric
                 Encrypt with symmetric cipher only.  This command asks for  a
                 passphrase.

       --store   Store only (make a simple RFC1991 packet).

       --decrypt [file]
                 Decrypt  file (or stdin if no file is specified) and write it
                 to stdout (or the  file  specified  with  --output).  If  the
                 decrypted  file  is  signed,  the signature is also verified.
                 This command differs from the default operation, as it  never
                 writes  to  the filename which is included in the file and it
                 rejects files which donât begin with an encrypted message.

       --verify [[sigfile]  [signed-files]]
                 Assume that sigfile is a signature and verify it without gen-
                 erating  any  output. With no arguments, the signature packet
                 is read from stdin.  If only a sigfile is given, it may be  a
                 complete signature or a detached signature, in which case the
               signed stuff is expected in a  file  without  the  ".sig"  or
                 ".asc"  extension.   With  more  than  1  argument, the first
                 should be a detached signature and the  remaining  files  are
                 the signed stuff.  To read the signed stuff from stdin, use -
                 as the second filename.  For security reasons a detached sig-
                 nature  cannot  read  the  signed material from stdin without
                 denoting it in the above way.

       --verify-files [files]
                 This is a special version of the --verify command which  does
                 not  work  with detached signatures.  The command expects the
                 files to be verified either on the command line or reads  the
                 filenames  from  stdin;   each name must be on separate line.
                 The command is intended for quick checking of many files.

       --encrypt-files [files]
                 This is a special version of the --encrypt command. The  com-
                 mand  expects the files to be encrypted either on the command
                 line or reads the filenames from stdin; each name must be  on
                 separate line. The command is intended for a quick encryption
                 of multiple files.

       --decrypt-files [files]
                 The same as --encrypt-files with the  difference  that  files
                 will be decrypted. The syntax or the filenames is the same.

       --list-keys [names]

       --list-public-keys [names]
                 List  all  keys  from  the  public keyrings, or just the ones
                 given on the command line.

       --list-secret-keys [names]
                 List all keys from the secret  keyrings,  or  just  the  ones
                 given  on  the  command  line.  A â#â after the letters âsecâ
                 means that the secret key is not usable (for example,  if  it
                 was created via --export-secret-subkeys).

       --list-sigs [names]
                 Same as --list-keys, but the signatures are listed too.

       --check-sigs [names]
                 Same as --list-sigs, but the signatures are verified.

       --fingerprint [names]
                 List  all keys with their fingerprints. This is the same out-
                 put as --list-keys but with the additional output of  a  line
                 with  the  fingerprint. May also be combined with --list-sigs
                 or --check-sigs.  If this command is given twice, the finger-
                 prints of all secondary keys are listed too.

       --list-packets
                 List  only the sequence of packets. This is mainly useful for
                 debugging.

       --gen-key Generate a new key pair. This command is normally  only  used
                 interactively.

                 There  is  an experimental feature which allows you to create
                 keys in batch mode. See the file doc/DETAILS  in  the  source
                 distribution on how to use this.

       --edit-key name
                 Present a menu which enables you to do all key related tasks:

                 sign      Make a signature on key of user name If the key  is
                           not  yet  signed  by the default user (or the users
                           given with -u), the program displays  the  informa-
                           tion  of  the  key again, together with its finger-
                           print and asks whether it should  be  signed.  This
                           question  is  repeated for all users specified with
                           -u.

                 lsign     Same as --sign but the signature is marked as  non-
                           exportable and will therefore never be used by oth-
                           ers.  This may be used to make keys valid  only  in
                           the local environment.

                 nrsign    Same  as --sign but the signature is marked as non-
                           revocable and can therefore never be revoked.

                 nrlsign   Combines the functionality of nrsign and  lsign  to
                           make  a  signature  that  is both non-revocable and
                           non-exportable.

                 revsig    Revoke a signature.  For every signature which  has
                           been  generated  by  one  of the secret keys, GnuPG
                           asks whether a  revocation  certificate  should  be
                           generated.

                 trust     Change  the  owner  trust  value.  This updates the
                           trust-db immediately and no save is required.

                 disable

                 enable    Disable or enable an entire key. A disabled key can
                           normally not be used for encryption.

                 adduid    Create an alternate user id.

                 addphoto  Create a photographic user id.

                 deluid    Delete a user id.

                 addkey    Add a subkey to this key.

                 delkey    Remove a subkey.
                addrevoker
                           Add  a designated revoker.  This takes one optional
                           argument: "sensitive".  If a designated revoker  is
                           marked  as  sensitive,  it  will not be exported by
                           default (see export-options).

                 revkey    Revoke a subkey.

                 expire    Change the key expiration time.   If  a  subkey  is
                           selected,  the  expiration time of this subkey will
                           be changed.  With no selection, the key  expiration
                           of the primary key is changed.

                 passwd    Change the passphrase of the secret key.

                 primary   Flag  the  current  user  id  as  the  primary one,
                           removes the primary user id  flag  from  all  other
                           user  ids  and  sets  the timestamp of all affected
                           self-signatures one second ahead.  Note  that  set-
                           ting  a  photo  user ID as primary makes it primary
                           over other photo user IDs, and  setting  a  regular
                           user ID as primary makes it primary over other reg-
                           ular user IDs.

                 uid n     Toggle selection of user id with index n.  Use 0 to
                           deselect all.

                 key n     Toggle  selection of subkey with index n.  Use 0 to
                           deselect all.

                 check     Check all selected user ids.

                 showphoto Display the selected photographic user id.

                 pref      List preferences from the selected user  ID.   This
                           shows the actual preferences, without including any
                           implied preferences.

                 showpref  More verbose preferences listing for  the  selected
                           user  ID.   This shows the preferences in effect by
                           including the implied preferences of 3DES (cipher),
                           SHA-1  (digest),  and Uncompressed (compression) if
                           they are not already  included  in  the  preference
                           list.

                 setpref string
                           Set the list of user ID preferences to string, this
                           should be a string similar to the  one  printed  by
                           "pref".  Using an empty string will set the default
                           preference string, using "none" will set the  pref-
                           erences  to  nil.   Use "gpg -v --version" to get a
                           list of available algorithms.   This  command  just
                           initializes  an  internal  list and does not change
                           anything unless another command (such as "updpref")
                       which changes the self-signatures is used.

                 updpref   Change  the preferences of all user IDs (or just of
                           the selected ones to the current  list  of  prefer-
                           ences.   The  timestamp of all affected self-signa-
                           tures will be advanced by one  second.   Note  that
                           while   you   can  change  the  preferences  on  an
                           attribute user ID (aka "photo ID"), GnuPG does  not
                           select keys via attribute user IDs so these prefer-
                           ences will not be used by GnuPG.

                 toggle    Toggle between public and secret key listing.

                 save      Save all changes to the key rings and quit.

                 quit      Quit the program without updating the key rings.

                 The listing shows you the key with its secondary keys and all
                 user  ids.  Selected  keys  or  user  ids are indicated by an
                 asterisk. The trust value is displayed with the primary  key:
                 the  first  is the assigned owner trust and the second is the
                 calculated trust value.  Letters are used for the values:

                 -         No ownertrust assigned / not yet calculated.

                 e         Trust calculation has failed; probably  due  to  an
                           expired key.

                 q         Not enough information for calculation.

                 n         Never trust this key.

                 m         Marginally trusted.

                 f         Fully trusted.

                 u         Ultimately trusted.

       --sign-key name
                 Signs  a  public key with your secret key. This is a shortcut
                 version of the subcommand "sign" from --edit.

       --lsign-key name
                 Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as  non-
                 exportable.   This  is  a  shortcut version of the subcommand
                 "lsign" from --edit.

       --nrsign-key name
                 Signs a public key with your secret key but marks it as  non-
                 revocable.   This  is  a  shortcut  version of the subcommand
                 "nrsign" from --edit.

       --delete-key name
                 Remove key from the public keyring.   In  batch  mode  either
                --yes  is  required  or  the key must be specified by finger-
                 print.  This is a safeguard against  accidental  deletion  of
                 multiple keys.

       --delete-secret-key  name
                 Remove  key from the secret and public keyring. In batch mode
                 the key must be specified by fingerprint.

       --delete-secret-and-public-key  name
                 Same as --delete-key, but if a secret key exists, it will  be
                 removed  first.  In  batch  mode the key must be specified by
                 fingerprint.

       --gen-revoke
                 Generate a revocation certificate for the  complete  key.  To
                 revoke a subkey or a signature, use the --edit command.

       --desig-revoke
                 Generate a designated revocation certificate for a key.  This
                 allows a user (with  the  permission  of  the  keyholder)  to
                 revoke someone elses key.

       --export [names]
                 Either  export  all  keys from all keyrings (default keyrings
                 and those registered via option --keyring), or  if  at  least
                 one  name  is given, those of the given name. The new keyring
                 is written to stdout or to the file given with  option  "out-
                 put".  Use together with --armor to mail those keys.

       --send-keys [names]
                 Same  as  --export but sends the keys to a keyserver.  Option
                 --keyserver must be used to give the name of this  keyserver.
                 Donât send your complete keyring to a keyserver - select only
                 those keys which are new or changed by you.

       --export-all [names]
                 Same as --export, but also exports keys which are not compat-
                 ible with OpenPGP.

       --export-secret-keys [names]

       --export-secret-subkeys [names]
                 Same  as --export, but exports the secret keys instead.  This
                 is normally not very useful and a security risk.  The  second
                 form  of  the  command has the special property to render the
                 secret part of the primary key useless; this is a GNU  exten-
                 sion to OpenPGP and other implementations can not be expected
                 to successfully import such a key.

                 See the option --simple-sk-checksum if  you  want  to  import
                 such an exported key with an older OpenPGP implementation.

       --import [files]
       --fast-import [files]
                 Import/merge  keys.  This adds the given keys to the keyring.
                 The fast version is currently just a synonym.

                 There are a few other options which control how this  command
                 works.   Most  notable  here is the --merge-only option which
                 does not insert new keys but does only  the  merging  of  new
                 signatures, user-IDs and subkeys.

       --recv-keys key IDs
                 Import  the  keys  with  the  given key IDs from a keyserver.
                 Option --keyserver must be used to give the name of this key-
                 server.

       --refresh-keys key IDs
                 Request  updates from a keyserver for keys that already exist
                 on the local keyring.  This is useful for updating a key with
                 the  latest  signatures,  user  IDs, etc.  Option --keyserver
                 must be used to give the name of this keyserver.

       --search-keys [names]
                 Search the keyserver for the  given  names.   Multiple  names
                 given  here  will  be  joined  together  to create the search
                 string for the keyserver.  Option --keyserver must be used to
                 give the name of this keyserver.

       --update-trustdb
                 Do trust DB maintenance.  This command goes over all keys and
                 builds the  Web-of-Trust.  This  is  an  interactive  command
                 because  it  may  has  to  ask for the "ownertrust" values of
                 keys.  The user has to give an  estimation  in  how  far  she
                 trusts  the  owner  of the displayed key to correctly certify
                 (sign) other keys.  It does only ask for that value if it has
                 not  yet  been  assigned to a key.  Using the edit menu, that
                 value can be changed at any time later.

       --check-trustdb
                 Do trust DB maintenance without user interaction.  Form  time
                 to  time  the  trust database must be updated so that expired
                 keys  and  resulting  changes  in  the  Web-of-Trust  can  be
                 tracked.   GnuPG  tries  to  figure when this is required and
                 then does it implicitly; this command can be  used  to  force
                 such  a  check.   The  processing  is  identically to that of
                 --update-trustdb but it skips keys with  a  not  yet  defined
                 "ownertrust".

                 For  use  with  cron  jobs, this command can be used together
                 with --batch in which case the check is only done when it  is
                 due.  To force a run even in batch mode add the option --yes.

       --export-ownertrust [file]
                 Store the ownertrust  values  into  file  (or  stdin  if  not
                 given).   This  is useful for backup purposes as these values
                 are the only ones which canât be re-created from a  corrupted
                 trust DB.

       --import-ownertrust [files]
                 Update the trustdb with the ownertrust values stored in files
                 (or stdin if not given); existing values will be overwritten.

       --rebuild-keydb-caches
                 When updating from version 1.0.6 to 1.0.7 this command should
                 be used to create signature caches in the keyring.  It  might
                 be handy in other situations too.

       --print-md algo [files]

       --print-mds [files]
                 Print message digest of algorithm ALGO for all given files or
                 stdin.  With the second form (or a deprecated  "*"  as  algo)
                 digests for all available algorithms are printed.

       --gen-random 0|1|2                 [count]
                 Emit  COUNT random bytes of the given quality level. If count
                 is not given or zero, an endless  sequence  of  random  bytes
                 will  be  emitted.  PLEASE, donât use this command unless you
                 know what you are doing; it may remove precious entropy  from
                 the system!

       --gen-prime mode                  bits             [qbits]
                 Use  the source, Luke :-). The output format is still subject
                 to change.

       --version Print version information along  with  a  list  of  supported
                 algorithms.

       --warranty
                 Print warranty information.

       -h, --help
                 Print  usage  information.   This  is a really long list even
                 though it doesnât list all options.

OPTIONS
       Long   options   can   be   put   in   an   options    file    (default
       "~/.gnupg/gpg.conf").   Short option names will not work - for example,
       "armor" is a valid option for the options file, while "a" is  not.   Do
       not  write  the  2  dashes,  but  simply the name of the option and any
       required arguments.  Lines with a hash (â#â) as  the  first  non-white-
       space character are ignored.  Commands may be put in this file too, but
       that does not make sense.

       gpg recognizes these options:

       -a, --armor
                 Create ASCII armored output.

       -o, --output file
                Write output to file.

       -u, --local-user name
                 Use name as the user ID to sign.   This  option  is  silently
                 ignored  for  the list commands, so that it can be used in an
                 options file.

       --default-key name
                 Use name as default user ID for signatures.  If this  is  not
                 used  the  default  user ID is the first user ID found in the
                 secret keyring.

       -r, --recipient name

                 Encrypt for user id name. If this option  is  not  specified,
                 GnuPG  asks  for  the  user-id  unless --default-recipient is
                 given

       --default-recipient name
                 Use name as default recipient if option  --recipient  is  not
                 used  and donât ask if this is a valid one. name must be non-
                 empty.

       --default-recipient-self
                 Use the default key as default recipient if option  --recipi-
                 ent  is  not  used  and donât ask if this is a valid one. The
                 default key is the first one from the secret keyring  or  the
                 one set with --default-key.

       --no-default-recipient
                 Reset --default-recipient and --default-recipient-self.

       --encrypt-to name
                 Same  as  --recipient but this one is intended for use in the
                 options file and may be used with  your  own  user-id  as  an
                 "encrypt-to-self".   These  keys are only used when there are
                 other recipients given either by use of --recipient or by the
                 asked user id.  No trust checking is performed for these user
                 ids and even disabled keys can be used.

       --no-encrypt-to
                 Disable the use of all --encrypt-to keys.

       -v, --verbose
                 Give more information during processing. If used  twice,  the
                 input data is listed in detail.

       -q, --quiet
                 Try to be as quiet as possible.

       -z n, --compress n
                 Set  compression level to n. A value of 0 for n disables com-
                 pression. Default is to use the default compression level  of
                 zlib (normally 6).

       -t, --textmode
                 Use  canonical text mode.  If -t (but not --textmode) is used
                 together with armoring and signing, this enables  clearsigned
                 messages.   This kludge is needed for PGP compatibility; nor-
                 mally you would use --sign or  --clearsign  to  selected  the
                 type of the signature.

       -n, --dry-run
                 Donât  make any changes (this is not completely implemented).

       -i, --interactive
                 Prompt before overwriting any files.

       --batch   Use batch mode.  Never ask, do  not  allow  interactive  com-
                 mands.

       --no-tty  Make  sure that the TTY (terminal) is never used for any out-
                 put.  This option is needed in some cases because GnuPG some-
                 times prints warnings to the TTY if --batch is used.

       --no-batch
                 Disable batch mode.  This may be of use if --batch is enabled
                 from an options file.

       --yes     Assume "yes" on most questions.

       --no      Assume "no" on most questions.

       --default-cert-check-level n
                 The default to use for the check level when signing a key.

                 0 means you make no particular claim as to how carefully  you
                 verified the key.

                 1 means you believe the key is owned by the person who claims
                 to own it but you could not, or did not  verify  the  key  at
                 all.   This is useful for a "persona" verification, where you
                 sign the key of a pseudonymous user.

                 2 means you did casual verification of the key.  For example,
                 this  could  mean  that you verified that the key fingerprint
                 and checked the user ID on the key against a photo ID.

                 3 means you did extensive verification of the key.  For exam-
                 ple,  this  could  mean that you verified the key fingerprint
                 with the owner of the key in person, and that you checked, by
                 means  of a hard to forge document with a photo ID (such as a
                 passport) that the name of the key owner matches the name  in
                 the  user  ID  on  the key, and finally that you verified (by
                 exchange of email) that the email address on the key  belongs
                 to the key owner.

                 Note  that  the  examples  given above for levels 2 and 3 are
                just that: examples.  In the end, it is up to you  to  decide
                 just what "casual" and "extensive" mean to you.

                 This option defaults to 0.

       --trusted-key long key ID
                 Assume that the specified key (which must be given as a  full
                 8 byte key ID) is as trustworthy as one of  your  own  secret
                 keys.  This  option  is useful if you donât want to keep your
                 secret keys (or one of them) online but still want to be able
                 to  check  the  validity of a given recipientâs or signatorâs
                 key.

       --always-trust
                 Skip key validation and assume  that  used  keys  are  always
                 fully  trusted.  You wonât use this unless you have installed
                 some external validation scheme.  This option also suppresses
                 the  "[uncertain]"  tag  printed  with  signature checks when
                 there is no evidence that the user ID is bound to the key.

       --keyserver name
                 Use name as your keyserver.  This is the server that  --recv-
                 keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will communicate with to
                 receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on.  The
                 format   of   the   name  is  a  URI:  âscheme:[//]keyserver-
                 name[:port]â The scheme is the type of keyserver:  "hkp"  for
                 the  Horowitz  (or compatible) keyservers, "ldap" for the NAI
                 LDAP keyserver, or "mailto" for the Horowitz email keyserver.
                 Note  that  your  particular  installation  of GnuPG may have
                 other keyserver types available as well.   Keyserver  schemes
                 are case-insensitive.

                 Most keyservers synchronize with each other, so there is gen-
                 erally no need to send keys to more than one  server.   Using
                 the command "host -l pgp.net | grep wwwkeys" gives you a list
                 of HKP keyservers.  When using one of  the  wwwkeys  servers,
                 due  to  load  balancing using round-robin DNS you may notice
                 that you get a different key server each time.

       --keyserver-options parameters
                 This is a space or comma delimited string that gives  options
                 for  the keyserver.  Options can be prepended with a âno-â to
                 give the opposite meaning.  Valid import-options  or  export-
                 options  may  be  used  here  as  well  to apply to importing
                 (--recv-key) or exporting (--send-key)  a  key  from  a  key-
                 server.   While  not  all  options are available for all key-
                 server types, some common options are:

                 include-revoked
                           When searching for a key,  include  keys  that  are
                           marked on the keyserver as revoked.  Note that this
                           option is always set when using the  NAI  HKP  key-
                           server,  as  this  keyserver does not differentiate
                           between revoked and unrevoked keys.  When using the
                           LDAP  keyserver,  this  applies  to  both searching
                           (--search-keys) and receiving (--recv-keys).

                 include-disabled
                           When receiving or searching for a key, include keys
                           that are marked on the keyserver as disabled.  Note
                           that this option is not used with  HKP  keyservers,
                           as they do not support disabling keys.

                 include-subkeys
                           When  receiving  a  key,  include  subkeys  in  the
                           search.  Note that this option is not used with HKP
                           keyservers,  as they do not support retrieving keys
                           by subkey id.

                 use-temp-files
                           On most  Unix-like  platforms,  GnuPG  communicates
                           with  the keyserver helper program via pipes, which
                           is the most efficient method.  This  option  forces
                           GnuPG  to  use  temporary files to communicate.  On
                           some platforms (such as Win32 and  RISC  OS),  this
                           option is always enabled.

                 keep-temp-files
                           If  using  âuse-temp-filesâ, do not delete the temp
                           files after using them.  This option is  useful  to
                           learn the keyserver communication protocol by read-
                           ing the temporary files.

                 verbose   Tell the keyserver helper program to be  more  ver-
                           bose.   This  option can be repeated multiple times
                           to increase the verbosity level.

                 honor-http-proxy
                           For keyserver schemes that use HTTP (such as  HKP),
                           try to access the keyserver over the proxy set with
                           the environment variable "http_proxy".

                 auto-key-retrieve
                           This option enables  the  automatic  retrieving  of
                           keys  from  a  keyserver  when verifying signatures
                           made by keys that are not on the local keyring.

       --import-options parameters
                 This is a space or comma delimited string that gives  options
                 for importing keys.  Options can be prepended with a âno-â to
                 give the opposite meaning.  The options are:

                 allow-local-sigs
                           Allow importing key signatures marked  as  "local".
                           This  is  not  generally  useful  unless  a  shared
                           keyring scheme is being used.  Defaults to no.

                 repair-hkp-subkey-bug
                          During import, attempt to repair the HKP  keyserver
                           mangling multiple subkeys bug.  Note that this can-
                           not completely repair the damaged key as some  cru-
                           cial  data is removed by the keyserver, but it does
                           at least give you back one subkey.  Defaults to  no
                           for  regular  --import  and  to  yes  for keyserver
                           --recv-keys.

       --export-options parameters
                 This is a space or comma delimited string that gives  options
                 for exporting keys.  Options can be prepended with a âno-â to
                 give the opposite meaning.  The options are:

                 include-non-rfc
                           Include  non-RFC  compliant  keys  in  the  export.
                           Defaults to yes.

                 include-local-sigs
                           Allow  exporting  key signatures marked as "local".
                           This  is  not  generally  useful  unless  a  shared
                           keyring scheme is being used.  Defaults to no.

                 include-attributes
                           Include   attribute  user  IDs  (photo  IDs)  while
                           exporting.  This is useful to export keys  if  they
                           are  going  to  be  used by an OpenPGP program that
                           does not accept attribute user  IDs.   Defaults  to
                           yes.

                 include-sensitive-revkeys
                           Include  designated  revoker  information  that was
                           marked as "sensitive".  Defaults to no.

       --show-photos
                 Causes --list-keys, --list-sigs, --list-public-keys,  --list-
                 secret-keys,  and  verifying  a signature to also display the
                 photo ID attached to the key,  if  any.   See  also  --photo-
                 viewer.

       --no-show-photos
                 Resets the --show-photos flag.

       --photo-viewer string
                 This  is  the command line that should be run to view a photo
                 ID.  "%i" will be  expanded  to  a  filename  containing  the
                 photo.   "%I"  does  the  same,  except  the file will not be
                 deleted once the viewer exits.  Other flags are "%k" for  the
                 key  ID,  "%K"  for the long key ID, "%f" for the key finger-
                 print, "%t" for the extension of the image type (e.g. "jpg"),
                 "%T"  for the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg"), and
                 "%%" for an actual percent sign.  If neither  %i  or  %I  are
                 present,  then  the  photo  will be supplied to the viewer on
                 standard input.
	                The default viewer is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title  âKeyID
                 0x%kâ stdin"

       --exec-path string
                 Sets  a  list  of directories to search for photo viewers and
                 keyserver helpers.  If not provided,  keyserver  helpers  use
                 the  compiled-in default directory, and photo viewers use the
                 $PATH environment variable.

       --show-keyring
                 Causes --list-keys,  --list-public-keys,  and  --list-secret-
                 keys  to  display the name of the keyring a given key resides
                 on. This is only useful when youâre listing a specific key or
                 set of keys. It has no effect when listing all keys.

       --keyring file
                 Add  file  to  the  list  of keyrings.  If file begins with a
                 tilde and a slash, these are replaced by the HOME  directory.
                 If the filename does not contain a slash, it is assumed to be
                 in the home-directory ("~/.gnupg" if --homedir is not  used).
                 The filename may be prefixed with a scheme:

                 "gnupg-ring:" is the default one.

                 It  might  make  sense  to use it together with --no-default-
                 keyring.

       --secret-keyring file
                 Same as --keyring but for the secret keyrings.

       --homedir directory
                 Set the name of the  home  directory  to  directory  If  this
                 option  is  not  used  it defaults to "~/.gnupg". It does not
                 make sense to use this in a options file. This also overrides
                 the environment variable "GNUPGHOME".

       --charset name
                 Set  the  name  of the native character set.  This is used to
                 convert some strings to proper UTF-8 encoding. If this option
                 is not used, the default character set is determined from the
                 current locale.  A verbosity level of 3 shows the  used  one.
                 Valid values for name are:

                 iso-8859-1
                           This is the Latin 1 set.

                 iso-8859-2
                           The Latin 2 set.

                 iso-8859-15
                           This is currently an alias for the Latin 1 set.

                 koi8-r    The usual Russian set (rfc1489).
	                 utf-8     Bypass all translations and assume that the OS uses
                           native UTF-8 encoding.

       --utf8-strings

       --no-utf8-strings
                 Assume that the arguments are already given as UTF8  strings.
                 The  default  (--no-utf8-strings) is to assume that arguments
                 are encoded in the character set as specified  by  --charset.
                 These  options  affect all following arguments.  Both options
                 may be used multiple times.

       --options file
                 Read options from file and do not try to read them  from  the
                 default  options  file  in  the homedir (see --homedir). This
                 option is ignored if used in an options file.

       --no-options
                 Shortcut for "--options /dev/null".  This option is  detected
                 before  an attempt to open an option file.  Using this option
                 will also prevent the creation of a "~./gnupg" homedir.

       --load-extension name
                 Load an extension module. If name does not contain a slash it
                 is  searched  for  in the directory configured when GnuPG was
                 built (generally "/usr/local/lib/gnupg").  Extensions are not
                 generally  useful anymore, and the use of this option is dep-
                 recated.

       --debug flags
                 Set debugging flags. All flags are or-ed  and  flags  may  be
                 given in C syntax (e.g. 0x0042).

       --debug-all
                 Set all useful debugging flags.

       --status-fd n
                 Write  special  status strings to the file descriptor n.  See
                 the file DETAILS in the documentation for a listing of  them.

       --logger-fd n
                 Write log output to file descriptor n and not to stderr.

       --attribute-fd n
                 Write attribute subpackets to the file descriptor n.  This is
                 most useful for use with --status-fd, since the  status  mes-
                 sages  are needed to separate out the various subpackets from
                 the stream delivered to the file descriptor.

       --sk-comments
                 Include secret key  comment  packets  when  exporting  secret
                 keys.  This is a GnuPG extension to the OpenPGP standard, and
                 is off by default.  Please note that this has nothing  to  do
                 with  the comments in clear text signatures or armor headers.
	
       --no-sk-comments
                 Resets the --sk-comments option.

       --no-comment
                 See --sk-comments.  This option  is  deprecated  and  may  be
                 removed soon.

       --comment string
                 Use  string  as comment string in clear text signatures.  The
                 default is not do write a comment string.

       --default-comment
                 Force to write the standard comment string in clear text sig-
                 natures.   Use  this  to  overwrite a --comment from a config
                 file.  This option  is  now  obsolete  because  there  is  no
                 default comment string anymore.

       --no-version
                 Omit the version string in clear text signatures.

       --emit-version
                 Force  to  write the version string in clear text signatures.
                 Use this to overwrite a previous --no-version from  a  config
                 file.

       -N, --notation-data name=value
                 Put  the name value pair into the signature as notation data.
                 name must consist only of alphanumeric characters, digits  or
                 the  underscore;  the  first  character  must not be a digit.
                 value may be any printable string;  it  will  be  encoded  in
                 UTF8,  so  you  should  check that your --charset is set cor-
                 rectly.  If you prefix name with  an  exclamation  mark,  the
                 notation data will be flagged as critical (rfc2440:5.2.3.15).

       --show-notation
                 Show key signature notations in the --list-sigs  or  --check-
                 sigs listings.

       --no-show-notation
                 Do  not  show  key  signature notations in the --list-sigs or
                 --check-sigs listings.

       --set-policy-url string
                 Use string as Policy URL for  signatures  (rfc2440:5.2.3.19).
                 If  you  prefix  it  with an exclamation mark, the policy URL
                 packet will be flagged as critical.

       --show-policy-url
                 Show any policy URLs set in the --list-sigs  or  --check-sigs
                 listings.

       --no-show-policy-url
                 Do  not  show  any  policy  URLs  set  in  the --list-sigs or
	                --check-sigs listings.

       --set-filename string
                 Use string as the name of file which is stored in messages.

       --for-your-eyes-only
                 Set the âfor your eyes  onlyâ  flag  in  the  message.   This
                 causes  GnuPG  to refuse to save the file unless the --output
                 option is given, and PGP to use the "secure  viewer"  with  a
                 Tempest-resistant  font  to display the message.  This option
                 overrides --set-filename.

       --no-for-your-eyes-only
                 Resets the --for-your-eyes-only flag.

       --use-embedded-filename
                 Try to create a file with a name as  embedded  in  the  data.
                 This  can  be  a  dangerous  option as it allows to overwrite
                 files.

       --completes-needed n
                 Number of completely trusted users to  introduce  a  new  key
                 signer (defaults to 1).

       --marginals-needed n
                 Number  of  marginally  trusted  users to introduce a new key
                 signer (defaults to 3)

       --max-cert-depth n
                 Maximum depth of a certification chain (default is 5).

       --cipher-algo name
                 Use  name as cipher algorithm. Running the program  with  the
                 command  --version  yields a list of supported algorithms. If
                 this is not used the cipher algorithm is  selected  from  the
                 preferences stored with the key.

       --digest-algo name
                 Use name as the message digest algorithm. Running the program
                 with the command --version yields a list of  supported  algo-
                 rithms.

       --cert-digest-algo name
                 Use  name as the message digest algorithm used when signing a
                 key.  Running the program with the command --version yields a
                 list of supported algorithms.  Be aware that if you choose an
                 algorithm that GnuPG supports but other  OpenPGP  implementa-
                 tions do not, then some users will not be able to use the key
                 signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key.

       --s2k-cipher-algo name
                 Use name as the cipher algorithm used to protect secret keys.
                 The  default  cipher  is CAST5.  This cipher is also used for
                 conventional encryption if --cipher-algo is not given.
 
       --s2k-digest-algo name
                 Use   name  as  the  digest  algorithm  used  to  mangle  the
                 passphrases.   The  default  algorithm  is RIPE-MD-160.  This
                 digest algorithm is also used for conventional encryption  if
                 --digest-algo is not given.

       --s2k-mode n
                 Selects  how  passphrases  are  mangled.  If  n  is 0 a plain
                 passphrase (which is not  recommended)  will  be  used,  a  1
                 (default)  adds a salt to the passphrase and a 3 iterates the
                 whole process a couple of times.  Unless --rfc1991  is  used,
                 this mode is also used for conventional encryption.

       --simple-sk-checksum
                 Secret  keys  are integrity protected by using a SHA-1 check-
                 sum.  This method will be part of an enhanced OpenPGP  speci-
                 fication  but  GnuPG  already  uses  it  as  a countermeasure
                 against certain attacks.  Old applications  donât  understand
                 this new format, so this option may be used to switch back to
                 the old behaviour.  Using this this option bears  a  security
                 risk.  Note that using this option only takes effect when the
                 secret key is encrypted - the simplest way to make this  hap-
                 pen  is to change the passphrase on the key (even changing it
                 to the same value is acceptable).

       --compress-algo n
                 Use compression algorithm n. Default is 2  which  is  RFC1950
                 compression.  You  may  use  1  to  use  the old zlib version
                 (RFC1951) which is used by PGP. 0 disables  compression.  The
                 default  algorithm may give better results because the window
                 size is not limited to 8K. If this is not  used  the  OpenPGP
                 behavior  is used, i.e. the compression algorithm is selected
                 from the preferences; note, that this canât be done if you do
                 not encrypt the data.

       --disable-cipher-algo name
                 Never  allow  the use of name as cipher algorithm.  The given
                 name will not be checked so that  a  later  loaded  algorithm
                 will still get disabled.

       --disable-pubkey-algo name
                 Never  allow  the  use  of name as public key algorithm.  The
                 given name will not be checked so that a later  loaded  algo-
                 rithm will still get disabled.

       --no-sig-cache
                 Do  not  cache  the  verification  status  of key signatures.
                 Caching gives a much  better  performance  in  key  listings.
                 However,  if you suspect that your public keyring is not save
                 against write modifications, you can use this option to  dis-
                 able the caching.  It probably does not make sense to disable
                 it because all kind of damage can be done if someone else has
                 write access to your public keyring.

       --no-sig-create-check
                 GnuPG  normally  verifies each signature right after creation
                 to protect against bugs and hardware malfunctions which could
                 leak  out  bits from the secret key.  This extra verification
                 needs some time (about 115% for DSA keys), and so this option
                 can be used to disable it.  However, due to the fact that the
                 signature creation needs manual interaction, this performance
                 penalty does not matter in most settings.

       --auto-check-trustdb
                 If  GnuPG  feels  that its information about the Web-of-Trust
                 has to be updated, it automatically runs the  --check-trustdb
                 command internally.  This may be a time consuming process.

       --no-auto-check-trustdb
                 Resets the --auto-check-trustdb option.

       --throw-keyid
                 Do  not  put  the  keyid into encrypted packets.  This option
                 hides the receiver of the message  and  is  a  countermeasure
                 against  traffic  analysis.   It may slow down the decryption
                 process because all available secret keys are tried.

       --not-dash-escaped
                 This option changes the behavior of cleartext  signatures  so
                 that  they  can  be used for patch files. You should not send
                 such an armored file via email because all  spaces  and  line
                 endings are hashed too.  You can not use this option for data
                 which has 5 dashes at the beginning of a  line,  patch  files
                 donât  have  this.  A  special  armor header line tells GnuPG
                 about this cleartext signature option.

       --escape-from-lines
                 Because some mailers change lines starting with  "From  "  to
                 "From  "  it  is  good to handle such lines in a special way
                 when creating cleartext signatures. All other PGP versions do
                 it  this  way  too.  This  option  is  not enabled by default
                 because it would violate rfc2440.

       --passphrase-fd n
                 Read the passphrase from file descriptor n. If you use 0  for
                 n,  the  passphrase  will be read from stdin.        This can
                 only be used if only one passphrase is supplied.   Donât  use
                 this option if you can avoid it.

       --command-fd n
                 This  is  a  replacement for the deprecated shared-memory IPC
                 mode.  If this option is enabled, user input on questions  is
                 not expected from the TTY but from the given file descriptor.
                 It should be used together with  --status-fd.  See  the  file
                 doc/DETAILS  in the source distribution for details on how to
                 use it.
       --use-agent
                 Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. Please note that  this  agent  is
                 still under development.  With this option, GnuPG first tries
                 to connect to the agent before it asks for a passphrase.

       --gpg-agent-info
                 Override   the   value   of    the    environment    variable
                 GPG_AGENT_INFO.   This is only used when --use-agent has been
                 given

       --rfc1991 Try to be more RFC1991 (PGP 2.x) compliant.

       --pgp2    Set up all options to be as PGP 2.x  compliant  as  possible,
                 and  warn if an action is taken (e.g. encrypting to a non-RSA
                 key) that will create a message that PGP 2.x will not be able
                 to  handle.   Note that âPGP 2.xâ here means âMIT PGP 2.6.2â.
                 There are other versions of PGP 2.x available,  but  the  MIT
                 release is a good common baseline.

                 This  option  implies  â--rfc1991  --no-openpgp --disable-mdc
                 --no-force-v4-certs --no-comment --escape-from-lines --force-
                 v3-sigs  --no-ask-sig-expire  --no-ask-cert-expire  --cipher-
                 algo IDEA --digest-algo MD5 --compress-algo 1â.  It also dis-
                 ables --textmode when encrypting.

       --no-pgp2 Resets the --pgp2 option.

       --pgp6    Set  up  all  options  to  be as PGP 6 compliant as possible.
                 This restricts you to the ciphers IDEA (if the IDEA plugin is
                 installed),  3DES,  and  CAST5,  the  hashes  MD5,  SHA1  and
                 RIPEMD160, and the compression algorithms none and ZIP.  This
                 also disables making signatures with signing subkeys as PGP 6
                 does not understand signatures made by signing subkeys.

                 This option  implies  â--disable-mdc  --no-comment  --escape-
                 from-lines  --force-v3-sigs  --no-ask-sig-expire  --compress-
                 algo 1â

       --no-pgp6 Resets the --pgp6 option.

       --pgp7    Set up all options to be as  PGP  7  compliant  as  possible.
                 This  is  identical  to  --pgp6 except that MDCs are not dis-
                 abled, and the list of allowable ciphers is expanded  to  add
                 AES128, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH.

       --no-pgp7 Resets the --pgp7 option.

       --openpgp Reset all packet, cipher and digest options to OpenPGP behav-
                 ior. Use this option  to  reset  all  previous  options  like
                 --rfc1991, --force-v3-sigs, --s2k-*, --cipher-algo, --digest-
                 algo and --compress-algo to OpenPGP  compliant  values.   All
                 PGP workarounds are also disabled.

       --force-v3-sigs
                 OpenPGP states that an implementation should generate v4 sig-
                 natures but PGP versions 5 and higher only recognize v4  sig-
                 natures  on  key  material.  This option forces v3 signatures
                 for signatures on data.   Note  that  this  option  overrides
                 --ask-sig-expire,  as  v3  signatures  cannot have expiration
                 dates.

       --no-force-v3-sigs
                 Reset the --force-v3-sigs option.

       --force-v4-certs
                 Always use v4 key signatures even on v3  keys.   This  option
                 also  changes the default hash algorithm for v3 RSA keys from
                 MD5 to SHA-1.

       --no-force-v4-certs
                 Reset the --force-v4-certs option.

       --force-mdc
                 Force the use of encryption  with  a  modification  detection
                 code.  This is always used with the newer ciphers (those with
                 a blocksize greater than 64 bits), or if  the  recipient  key
                 has one of those ciphers as a preference.

       --disable-mdc
                 Disable  the  use  of  the modification detection code.  Note
                 that by using this option, the encrypted message becomes vul-
                 nerable to a message modification attack.

       --allow-non-selfsigned-uid
                 Allow  the import and use of keys with user IDs which are not
                 self-signed.  This is not recommended, as a  non  self-signed
                 user ID is trivial to forge.

       --no-allow-non-selfsigned-uid
                 Reset the --allow-non-selfsigned-uid option.

       --allow-freeform-uid
                 Disable  all checks on the form of the user ID while generat-
                 ing a new one.  This option should only be used in very  spe-
                 cial environments as it does not ensure the de-facto standard
                 format of user IDs.

       --ignore-time-conflict
                 GnuPG normally checks that  the  timestamps  associated  with
                 keys  and  signatures  have plausible values.  However, some-
                 times a signature seems to be older than the key due to clock
                 problems.  This option makes these checks just a warning.

       --ignore-valid-from
                 GnuPG normally does not select and use subkeys created in the
                 future.  This option allows the use of  such  keys  and  thus
                 exhibits  the  pre-1.0.7  behaviour.  You should not use this
                 option unless you there is some clock problem.

       --ignore-crc-error
                 The ASCII armor used by OpenPGP is protected by a CRC  check-
                 sum  against  transmission errors.  Sometimes it happens that
                 the CRC gets mangled somewhere on  the  transmission  channel
                 but  the  actual  content  (which is protected by the OpenPGP
                 protocol anyway) is still okay.  This  option  will  let  gpg
                 ignore CRC errors.

       --ignore-mdc-error
                 This option changes a MDC integrity protection failure into a
                 warning.  This can be useful if a message is  partially  cor-
                 rupt, but it is necessary to get as much data as possible out
                 of the corrupt message.  However, be aware that a MDC protec-
                 tion failure may also mean that the message was tampered with
                 intentionally by an attacker.

       --lock-once
                 Lock the databases the first time a lock is requested and  do
                 not release the lock until the process terminates.

       --lock-multiple
                 Release  the locks every time a lock is no longer needed. Use
                 this to override a previous --lock-once from a config file.

       --lock-never
                 Disable locking entirely.  This option should be used only in
                 very  special environments, where it can be assured that only
                 one process is accessing those files.  A bootable floppy with
                 a  stand-alone  encryption  system  will  probably  use this.
                 Improper usage of this option may lead to data and  key  cor-
                 ruption.

       --no-random-seed-file
                 GnuPG  uses  a  file  to  store its internal random pool over
                 invocations.  This makes random  generation  faster;  however
                 sometimes  write operations are not desired.  This option can
                 be used to achieve that with the cost of slower random gener-
                 ation.

       --no-verbose
                 Reset verbose level to 0.

       --no-greeting
                 Suppress the initial copyright message but do not enter batch
                 mode.

       --no-secmem-warning
                 Suppress the warning about "using insecure memory".

       --no-permission-warning
                 Suppress the warning about unsafe file permissions.

       --no-mdc-warning
                Suppress the warning about missing MDC integrity  protection.

       --no-armor
                 Assume the input data is not in ASCII armored format.

       --no-default-keyring
                 Do not add the default keyrings to the list of keyrings.

       --skip-verify
                 Skip  the  signature  verification step.  This may be used to
                 make the decryption faster if the signature  verification  is
                 not needed.

       --with-colons
                 Print  key listings delimited by colons.  Note, that the out-
                 put will be encoded in UTF-8 regardless of any --charset set-
                 ting.

       --with-key-data
                 Print  key  listings delimited by colons (like --with-colons)
                 and print the public key data.

       --with-fingerprint
                 Same as the command --fingerprint but changes only the format
                 of  the output and may be used together with another command.

       --fast-list-mode
                 Changes the output of the list commands to work faster;  this
                 is  achieved  by leaving some parts empty.  Some applications
                 donât need the user ID and the trust information given in the
                 listings.   By using this options they can get a faster list-
                 ing.  The exact behaviour of this option may change in future
                 versions.

       --fixed-list-mode
                 Do  not merge user ID and primary key in --with-colon listing
                 mode and print all timestamps as seconds since 1970-01-01.

       --list-only
                 Changes the behaviour of some commands.  This is like  --dry-
                 run  but  different in some cases.  The semantic of this com-
                 mand may be extended in the future.  Currently it only  skips
                 the actual decryption pass and therefore enables a fast list-
                 ing of the encryption keys.

       --no-literal
                 This is not for normal use.  Use the source to see  for  what
                 it might be useful.

       --set-filesize
                 This  is  not for normal use.  Use the source to see for what
                 it might be useful.

       --emulate-md-encode-bug
                 GnuPG versions prior to 1.0.2 had a bug in the way  a  signa-
                 ture  was  encoded.   This  options  enables  a workaround by
                 checking faulty signatures again with the  encoding  used  in
                 old  versions.   This  may only happen for ElGamal signatures
                 which are not widely used.

       --show-session-key
                 Display the session key used for one message. See --override-
                 session-key for the counterpart of this option.

                 We  think  that  Key-Escrow  is a Bad Thing; however the user
                 should have the freedom to decide whether to go to prison  or
                 to reveal the content of one specific message without compro-
                 mising all messages ever encrypted for one secret key.  DONâT
                 USE IT UNLESS YOU ARE REALLY FORCED TO DO SO.

       --override-session-key string
                 Donât  use  the  public  key but the session key string.  The
                 format of this string is the  same  as  the  one  printed  by
                 --show-session-key.   This  option  is  normally not used but
                 comes handy in case someone forces you to reveal the  content
                 of  an  encrypted  message; using this option you can do this
                 without handing out the secret key.

       --ask-sig-expire
                 When making a data signature, prompt for an expiration  time.
                 If  this  option  is  not  specified,  the expiration time is
                 "never".

       --no-ask-sig-expire
                 Resets the --ask-sig-expire option.

       --ask-cert-expire
                 When making a key signature, prompt for an  expiration  time.
                 If  this  option  is  not  specified,  the expiration time is
                 "never".

       --no-ask-cert-expire
                 Resets the --ask-cert-expire option.

       --expert  Allow the user to do certain nonsensical  or  "silly"  things
                 like  signing  an  expired  or revoked key, or certain poten-
                 tially incompatible things  like  generating  deprecated  key
                 types.   This  also  disables  certain warning messages about
                 potentially incompatible actions.  As the name implies,  this
                 option  is  for  experts only.  If you donât fully understand
                 the implications of what it allows you to do, leave this off.

       --no-expert
                 Resets the --expert option.

       --merge-only
                 Donât  insert  new  keys  into  the  keyrings  while doing an
                 import.

       --allow-secret-key-import
                 This is an obsolete option and is not used anywhere.

       --try-all-secrets
                 Donât look at the key ID as stored in the message but try all
                 secret  keys  in turn to find the right decryption key.  This
                 option forces the behaviour as used by  anonymous  recipients
                 (created by using --throw-keyid) and might come handy in case
                 where an encrypted message contains a bogus key ID.

       --enable-special-filenames
                 This options enables a mode in which filenames  of  the  form
                 -&n,  where  n is a non-negative decimal number, refer to the
                 file descriptor n and not to a file with that name.

       --no-expensive-trust-checks
                 Experimental use only.

       --group name=value1 [value2 value3 ...]
                 Sets up a named group, which is similar to aliases  in  email
                 programs.   Any  time  the  group name is a receipient (-r or
                 --recipient), it will be expanded to the values specified.

                 The values are key IDs or fingerprints, but any key  descrip-
                 tion  is  accepted.  Note that a value with spaces in it will
                 be treated as two different values.  Note also there is  only
                 one level of expansion - you cannot make an group that points
                 to another group.

       --preserve-permissions
                 Donât change the permissions of a secret keyring back to user
                 read/write  only.   Use  this  option only if you really know
                 what you are doing.

       --personal-cipher-preferences string
                 Set the list of personal cipher preferences to  string,  this
                 list  should  be  a  string similar to the one printed by the
                 command "pref" in the edit menu.  This  allows  the  user  to
                 factor  in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
                 chosen via recipient key preferences.

       --personal-digest-preferences string
                 Set the list of personal digest preferences to  string,  this
                 list  should  be  a  string similar to the one printed by the
                 command "pref" in the edit menu.  This  allows  the  user  to
                 factor  in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
                 chosen via recipient key preferences.

       --personal-compress-preferences string
                 Set the list of personal compression preferences  to  string,
                 this  list  should  be a string similar to the one printed by
                 the command "pref" in the edit menu.  This allows the user to
                 factor  in their own preferred algorithms when algorithms are
                 chosen via recipient key preferences.

       --default-preference-list string
                 Set the list of default  preferences  to  string,  this  list
                 should  be a string similar to the one printed by the command
                 "pref" in the edit menu.  This affects  both  key  generation
                 and "updpref" in the edit menu.

How to specify a user ID
       There are different ways on how to specify a user ID to GnuPG; here are
       some examples:

       234567C4

       0F34E556E

       01347A56A

       0xAB123456
                 Here the key ID is given in the usual short form.

       234AABBCC34567C4

       0F323456784E56EAB

       01AB3FED1347A5612

       0x234AABBCC34567C4
                 Here the key ID is given in the long form as used by  OpenPGP
                 (you can get the long key ID using the option --with-colons).

       1234343434343434C434343434343434

       123434343434343C3434343434343734349A3434

       0E12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434

       0xE12343434343434343434EAB3484343434343434
                 The best way to specify a key ID is by using the  fingerprint
                 of  the  key.  This avoids any ambiguities in case that there
                 are duplicated key IDs (which are really rare  for  the  long
                 key IDs).

       =Heinrich Heine <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>
                 Using  an  exact  to  match string.  The equal sign indicates
                 this.

       <heinrichh@uni-duesseldorf.de>
                 Using the email address part which must  match  exactly.  The
                 left angle bracket indicates this email address mode.

       +Heinrich Heine duesseldorf
                 All  words  must  match  exactly (not case sensitive) but can
                 appear in any order in the user ID.  Words are any  sequences
                 of  letters,  digits,  the underscore and all characters with
                 bit 7 set.

       Heine

       *Heine    By case insensitive substring matching.  This is the  default
                 mode but applications may want to explicitly indicate this by
                 putting the asterisk in front.

       Note that you can append an exclamation mark  to  key  IDs  or  finger-
       prints.  This flag tells GnuPG to use exactly the given primary or sec-
       ondary key and not to try to figure out which secondary or primary  key
       to use.

RETURN VALUE
       The program returns 0 if everything was fine, 1 if at least a signature
       was bad, and other error codes for fatal errors.

EXAMPLES
       gpg -se -r Bob file
                 sign and encrypt for user Bob

       gpg --clearsign file
                 make a clear text signature

       gpg -sb  file
                 make a detached signature

       gpg --list-keys  user_ID
                 show keys

       gpg --fingerprint  user_ID
                 show fingerprint

       gpg --verify  pgpfile

       gpg --verify  sigfile [files]
                 Verify the signature of the file but do not output the  data.
                 The  second  form is used for detached signatures, where sig-
                 file is the  detached  signature  (either  ASCII  armored  of
                 binary) and [files] are the signed data; if this is not given
                 the name of the file holding the signed data  is  constructed
                 by cutting off the extension (".asc" or ".sig") of sigfile or
                 by asking the user for the filename.

ENVIRONMENT
       HOME      Used to locate the default home directory.

       GNUPGHOME If set directory used instead of "~/.gnupg".

       GPG_AGENT_INFO
                 Used to locate the gpg-agent; only honored  when  --use-agent
                 is  set.  The value consists of 3 colon delimited fields: The
                 first is the path to the Unix Domain Socket, the  second  the
                 PID of the gpg-agent and the protocol version which should be
                 set to 1.  When starting the gpg-agent as  described  in  its
                 documentation,  this  variable  is  set to the correct value.
                 The option --gpg-agent-info can be used to override it.

       http_proxy
                 Only honored when the  keyserver-option  honor-http-proxy  is
                 set.

WARNINGS
       Use a *good* password for your user account and a *good* passphrase  to
       protect  your  secret  key.  This passphrase is the weakest part of the
       whole system.  Programs to do dictionary attacks on your secret keyring
       are  very  easy  to  write  and  so you should protect your "~/.gnupg/"
       directory very well.

       Keep in mind that, if this program is used over a network (telnet),  it
       is *very* easy to spy out your passphrase!

       line or using - to specify stdin.

BUGS
       On  many systems this program should be installed as setuid(root). This
       is necessary to lock memory pages. Locking memory  pages  prevents  the
       operating system from writing memory pages to disk. If you get no warn-
       ing message about insecure memory your operating system supports  lock-
       ing  without  being  root. The program drops root privileges as soon as
       locked memory is allocated.
