        <h4><strong>Analysis</strong> - emphasizes an investigation of the problem and requirements, rather than a solution.</h4>
        <h4>Analysis is a broad term, best qualified, as in requirements analysis (investigation of the requirements), or object investigation ( investigation of domain objects).</h4>
        <h4>&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4><strong>Design</strong> emphasizes a conceptual solution that fulfills the requirements, rather than its implementation. Ex, description of the database schema and software objects.</h4>
        <h4>For example, object design or database design.</h4>
        <h4>Do the right thing (<strong>analysis</strong>), do the thing right (<strong>design</strong>). </h4>
        <p><strong>Object Oriented Analysis and Design </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4> Analysis - find and describe the objects or concepts in the public domain.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Design - define software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4> Implementation - design objects are implemented.</h4>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>A few key steps</strong></p>
        <ul>

            <h4>Define Use Case - a written story.</h4>
          </li>
          <li>Define a Domain Model - description of the domain from the perspective of the objects.</li>
          <li>Define Interactive Diagrams - shows the flow of messages softwarte objects, and the invocation of the methods.</li>
          <li>Define Design Class Diagrams - illustrates the attributes and methods of classes. </li>

        <h3> Iterative Development<br/>
	    </h3>
        <div class="blue">
          <p><small>A software development process describes an approach to building, deploying and maintaining software. The UP has emerged as a popular software development process for building object oriented systems. It is an iterative process. The RUP is a detailed refinement of the UP.</small></p>
          <p>Short fixed length mini-projects called <strong>Iterations</strong>. The outcome of each is a tested, integrated and executable system. Each iteration includes its own requirements analysis, design, implementation, and testing activities. Cyclic feedback and adaption as core drivers to converge upon a suitable system. The system grows incrementally over time, iteration by iteration. Thus this approach is also known as <strong>iterative and incremental development. </strong></p>
        </div>
			<p><strong>UP Phases and Schedule-Oriented Terms</strong></p>
			<ol>
			  <li>
			    <h4>Inception - approximate vision, business case, scope, vague estimates (feasibility phase). </h4>
			  </li>
	          <li>
	            <h4>Elaboration - refined vision, iterative implementation of the core architecture, resolution of high risks, identification of most requirements and scope, more realistic estimates (core architecture is iteratively implemented, high risk issues are mitigated). </h4>
	          </li>
		      <li>
		        <h4>Construction - iterative implementation of the remaining lower risk and easier elements, and preparation for deployment.</h4>
		      </li>
		      <li>
		        <h4>Transition - beta tests, deployment.  <br/>
                </h4>
		      </li>
        </ol>
		    <p><strong>UP Disciplines</strong></p>
		    <p>A discipline is a set of activities (and related artifacts) in one subject area. For example:</p>
		    <ul>
		      <li>Business Modeling</li>
              <li>Requirements</li>
	          <li>Design</li>
	          <li>Implementation</li>
	          <li>Test</li>
	          <li>Deployment</li>
	          <li>Configuration &amp; Change Management</li>
	          <li>Project Management</li>
	          <li>Environment</li>
        </ul>
	        <p>An interation, a mini-project, will require work in most displines. The relative effort and emphasis change over time.</p>
	        <p><strong>Artifact</strong></p>
	        <p>An artifact is the general term for any work product: code, Web graphics, database schema, text documents, diagrams, models etc. </p>
        <h4>All artifacts and activities are optional. In practice, focus on a small set of artifacts that demonstrate high practical value. </h4>
        <p>The choice of UP artifacts for a project may be written up in a short document called the <strong>Development Case.</strong> </p>
        <p><strong>Heavy Process</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>many artifacts created in a bureaucratic atmosphere.</li>
          <li>rigidity and control.</li>
          <li>elaborate, long-term, detailed planning.</li>
          <li>predictive rather than adaptive.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Predictive Process</strong></p>
        <p>Is a process that attempts to plan and predict the activities and resource (people) allocations in detail over a relatively long time span, such as the majority of a project. They usually have a &quot;waterfall&quot; of sequential lifecycle.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Define all of the requirements.</li>
          <li>Define a detailed design.</li>
          <li>Implementation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Adaptive Process </strong></p>
        <p>Is a process that accepts change as an inevitable driver and encourages flexible adaption. They usually have an iterative lifecycle.</p>
        <p><strong>Agile Process  </strong></p>
        <p>Implies a light and adaptive process, nimble in response to changing needs. UP is meant to be an Agile Process.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A small set of UP activities and artifacts. Keep it simple.</li>
          <li>Requirements and designs are not completed befored implementation. They adaptively emerge through a series of iterations, based on feedback.</li>
          <li>There isn't a detaIled plan. There is a high level plan called the <strong>Phase Plan</strong> that estimates the project end and other major milestones. </li>
          <li>A detailed plan called the <strong>Iteration Plan</strong> only plans greater detail one iteration in advance. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>The Sequential &quot;Waterfall&quot; Lifecycle</strong></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Clarify, record, and commit to a set of complete and frozen requirements.</li>
          <li>Design a system based on these requirements.</li>
          <li>Implement, based on ther design.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Inception</strong></p>
        <p>Envision the product scope, vision, and business case.</p>
        <p>Do the stakeholders have basic agreement on the vision of the project, and is it worth investing in serious investigation? </p>
        <p>Do enough investigation to form a rational, justifiable opinion of the overall purpose and feasibility of the potential new system, and decide if it is worhwhile to invest in deeper exploration (the purpose of the elaboration phase).</p>
        <p><strong>Artifacts that May Start in Inception</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Vision and Business Case </li>
          <li>Use-Case Model</li>
          <li>Supplementary Specification</li>
          <li>Glossary</li>
          <li>Risk List &amp; Risk Management Plan</li>
          <li>Prototypes and proof-of-concepts</li>
          <li>Iteration Plan</li>
          <li>Phase Plan &amp; Software Development Plan</li>
          <li>Development Case</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All artifacts are optional. Create only if they add real value to the project. Record all artifacts digitally and online-available at the project's website.</p>
        <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>
        <p>The FURPS+ model:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functional - features, capabilities, security.</li>
          <li>Usability - human factors, help, documentation.</li>
          <li>Reliability - frequency of failure, recoverability, predictability.</li>
          <li>Performance - response times, throughpur, accuracy, availability, resource usage.</li>
          <li>Supportability - adaptability, manitainability, internationalization, configurability.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The &quot;+ indicates ancillary and sub-factors, such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Implementation - resource limitations, languages and tools, hardware....</li>
          <li>Interface - constraints imposed by interfacing with external systems.</li>
          <li>Operations - system management in its operational setting.</li>
          <li>Packaging</li>
          <li>Legal - licensing etc</li>
