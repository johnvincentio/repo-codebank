        <h2><a name="TOP" id="TOP"></a>JUnit</h2>
        <p>I first worked with JUnit after a class talked about it. I just tried to make it work, see what i could do, what things I could use it for, what it would need from me.</p>
        <p>I recently worked some more with JUnit to see how to build an environment that may be used in a commercial setting. Thus, I set the main JUnit test class at the top of a hierachy, and put the modules to be subjected to JUnit tests in subdirectories. My work showed this to be a viable structure.</p>
        <p>Having played with the knight program, and wishing, at some point to continue my work, I could see that here is an abvious candidate for JUnit. I thus experimented with how to go about doing this. </p>
        <p>The recursive nature of the application does not lend itself well to JUnit, nor does the vast number of moves. The only real alternative is to keep a baseline set of results and compare new results against that baseline. If identical, then the new program is no worse than the previous version!</p>
        <p>The JUnit solution is to test to ensure the first X solutions for each square are identical to solutions known to JUnit. This appears to work just fine.</p>
        <p>A probably better method is to just write Y results to a file and compare the file to a baseline file of results. Not exactly JUnit stuff.</p>

        <h2><a name="CC2" id="CC2"></a>Cactus</h2>
        <p>I worked some with Cactus but found myself stymied in every direction. The Cactus install mentions only servers that I do not have, althought SunOneApplication Server is based on Tomcat. Cactus requires an older version of WebLogic and doesn't even mention WebSphere.</p>
        <p>The install wanted changes to the server configuration. I just don't want to risk my systems. A reinstall would endanger my deadlines.</p>
        <p>I tried to workaround the problems but got nowhere. Nothing worked, not even the demo code. Not too surprising, I suppose, but very frustrating none the less.</p>
        <p>I worked on this for quite some time before giving up. </p>
